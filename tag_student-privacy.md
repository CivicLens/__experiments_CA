## 2023-10-19 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The regular board meeting on October 19, 2023, discussed several key issues, including parental rights, student privacy, and book access. The board voted on a proposed amendment to Board Policy 5020.1 regarding parental rights, which sparked significant debate. While some supported the policy as it stands, others argued for amendments to ensure students have access to a diverse range of books and information. The board ultimately decided to approve the policy with modifications, specifically removing the first bullet point regarding equitable access to a full library of age-appropriate books, pending rewording.

The meeting also addressed school safety concerns, particularly following a previous board meeting where disruptions led to some members walking out. There were discussions about the need for security at meetings and on school campuses. Additionally, the board approved an agreement with Liberty Justice Center for legal services in anticipation of potential litigation related to the Parent Notification Policy, which has been controversial and faced public criticism.

Community engagement was evident throughout the meeting, with numerous public comments from parents and community members expressing both support and opposition to the board's actions. Concerns were raised about teacher and staff shortages, with acknowledgments of recent staff departures. The board also discussed the need for ethical considerations, especially regarding potential conflicts of interest in decision-making processes.

## 2023-09-07 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The regular board meeting on September 7, 2023, included significant discussions and decisions on various policies and community issues. A key focus was the proposed board policy regarding parent/guardian notification, which was subject to a second reading and approval. This policy, which garnered both support and opposition from the public, emphasizes parental rights and student privacy. Trustee Erickson proposed tabling this item due to ongoing legal actions against a similar policy in another district, but the motion failed. The policy was eventually adopted with clarifications suggested by Trustee Miner, despite some board members leaving the meeting due to safety concerns.

Community engagement was evident through multiple public comments, with individuals expressing strong opinions on both sides of the parental notification policy. The board also handled various administrative matters, including the approval of unaudited financial reports, textbook sufficiency, and amendments to existing resolutions related to the California Schools Healthy Air, Plumbing and Efficiency Program. Additionally, there was a focus on school safety, with discussions on meeting conduct and the need for policies to manage disruptive behavior during board meetings. The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of community partnerships and initiatives aimed at enhancing student safety and success.
