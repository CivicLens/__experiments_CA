## 2024-02-08 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Agenda)

The Orange Unified School District held a Regular Board Meeting on February 8, 2024, where several key actions and resolutions were discussed. Notably, the board adopted Resolution No. 16-23-24, which authorized a sole source contract with A&TS.p.A./Myrtha Pools, USA for the acquisition of Myrtha pool products in connection with the Villa Park High School Aquatic Center Project, with an amount not to exceed $1,100,000. This decision was based on the determination that A&TS.p.A. is the only authorized reseller in the United States for Myrtha products, allowing the district to bypass competitive bidding.

Additionally, the board approved various funding requests for special education services, including expenses related to students with exceptional needs, totaling up to $20,000 for one case and $50,000 for another. The meeting also included a Memorandum of Understanding with Maryville University for the placement of clinical student teachers in physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology, effective from February 9, 2024, through February 8, 2028, which aims to enhance community engagement and support for special education initiatives.
