4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Public Contract Code Section 20118 states if there is an existing contract between a public agency and a vendor
for the lease or purchase of the lease data-processing equipment, purchase materials, supplies, equipment, automotive vehicles,
tractors, and other personal property, the governing board of a school district may authorize the lease or purchase of such
personal property directly from the vendor under the same terms of another public agency contract.
On March 12, 2020, the Board of Education approved the renewal of Contract Number MNNVP-137 - DYNABOOK awarded by
Western States Contracting Alliance (WSCA/NASPO) to Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc., now known as Dynabook
Americas, Inc., for the purchase of Computer Equipment (laptops, tablets, including related peripherals & services). The District
has utilizedDynabook devices for the past eight years with success. The student devices were well-received by the community,
providing thin and light portability with a 14 high-definitionscreen.
The State extended the NASPO Master Agreement No. MNNVP-137 effective through July 31, 2023. Staff recommends that the
Board of Education authorize the use of Contract Number MNNVP-137, at the same prices, terms and conditions as extended.

FISCAL IMPACT: Expenditures will be made as needed from various funds not to exceed available budget appropriations.

establishing a universal fee structure for the use of facilities. In the past, the District has contracted with Cooperative Strategies

services to prepare Division of the State Architect ("DSA") plans for the gymnasium renovations at El Modena, Orange, and Villa
Park High Schools.
An amendment to the original agreement is required to capture added scope of work identified by the team to complete the
project. This work includes extending the electrical distribution, adding an HVAC disconnect to the fire alarm system, renovating
two restrooms for ADA compliance at each site, adding ceiling fans in the gyms for El Modena and Villa Park High Schools, and
the addition of seismic upgrades at Villa Park High School. To prepare the plan drawings for the additional scope of work and
submit them to DSA for their review and approval, LPA proposed a fee of $221,400, which willincrease the contract amount from
$1,102,215 to $1,323,615.Staff determined that the proposed amount is fair and reasonable.

DESCRIPTION:Each year, the Nutrition Services Divisionof the California Department of Education calculates the annual USDA
Commodity Entitlement Allocation for all school districts participating in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast
Programs. The calculationisbased on the total lunches served during the prior year.

The Super Co-Op is a California purchasing cooperative for the administration and distribution of the USDA Commodity
Entitlement Allocation for School Nutrition Programs. The San Mateo-Foster City School District is the lead agency for the Super
Co-Op and is given authority to contract for USDA Foods and related services on behalf of member districts. During the 20222023 school year, 231 California school districts participated in the Super Co-Op. Orange USD has been a member of the Super
Co-Op for over 10 years.

Benefits to membership includeincreased purchasing power and reduced food costs, enhanced menu flexibility, reduced
administrative burden for member districts, and access to the Super Co-Op web portal, which provides a dashboard to track
commodity entitlement utilization throughout the year.In the event that other member districts do not fully utilize their commodity
entitlement allocation, Orange USD has the opportunity to receive additional funding through periodic commodity entitlement
sweeps performed by the lead agency.

Fees for the Super Co-Op include (1) an annual renewal fee beginning the 2nd year of membership, which is calculated as0.3%
of the current year's USDA Foods estimated entitlement on July 1, and (2) State Administrative Fees of $0.90 per case/unit of
USDA Foods direct delivery (brown box) and diverted to processors.

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign

persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give the districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term needs.
This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential authorization for
one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover assignments
when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while searching for an
individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It also allows the
individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.
The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.
FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact.

DESCRIPTION: In May 2022, the Board of Education approved to enter into contracts with varied staffing agencies, including
Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc. Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc provides both general education and special education staffing
support due to staffing shortages for the period of July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023. District usage of staffing agencies is
based on availability of candidates from the various agencies.

The District has fully budgeted for all special education positions as part of the Adopted Budget for the 2022-23 school year.
Throughout the year, the budget projections have been revised for unfilled positions. At this point, the special education program
has experienced more than $4.0 million in unfilled positions.
As a result of the unfilled positions, the District has contracted with Maxim Healthcare Services to provide much-needed
personnel to provide necessary services to students. An amendment NO 2 is required in the amount of $1.12 million, bringing
the total contract amount to $1.97 to complete services through June 30, 2023.
