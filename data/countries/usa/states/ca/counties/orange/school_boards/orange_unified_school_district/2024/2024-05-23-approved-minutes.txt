Procedural: A. Public Comment
Public comments:
Scott Resnick, OUSD parent: Is sad to see the Jordan principal leave. The community deserves the perfect candidate and a say in
the selection. The candidate needs to have experience and be selected by the Jordan community. If you can't find one, consider
an interim first, don't settle.
Julie Lopiccolo, OUSD parent: Teachers and parents give countless hours to the school. Consider the specific needs of bilingual
programs. Jordan community will come together and help find a principal with experience.
