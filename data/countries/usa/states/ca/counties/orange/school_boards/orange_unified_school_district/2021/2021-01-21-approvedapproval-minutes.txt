4. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Hansen wished everyone a "Happy New Year", stating this was the first board meeting back after the
holidays. She is excited to share some news regarding the work that's going on in Orange Unified. The OUSD
Facilities Master Plan Town Hall (FMP) meetings are better attended as virtual meetings. The process of the Facilities
Master Plan is unfolding. Ed Services joined with Facilities to determine the goals for improvement to the elementary
sites in the feeder pattern for the high schools. LPA is the architectural firm, who are our partners, working with us on
the process. Eventually this plan will be brought back to the board for a decision and vote. Dr. Hansen expressed her
thanks to the board members that have participated.
Dr. Hansen gave an update on Measure S, a short video was shown. Measure S Phase I construction continues to
progress at El Modena, Villa Park, and Canyon HS. El Modena High School, STEM Center project's framing is
complete, and roofing will begin soon. Villa Park High School's STEM Center is making headway, and moving closer to
scheduled completion. The ground floor walls have started to get framed in and the second-story concrete floor has
been poured. Canyon High School's STEM Center is progressing well, with framing of the exterior walls being put in
place while final preparations for ground-level concrete to take place. We are excited about these new STEM Centers
and can't wait for the grand openings to share with the community.
Other updates; today the District received notice that we have been approved for a South Coast Air Quality
Management Carl Moyer Infrastructure Program grant of almost 1 million dollars to fund the upgrade of existing natural
gas (CNG) compressors, the CNG, and charging stations infrastructure at the Transportation Yard. We are also
pleased to share that Nutrition Services received $612,507 in supplemental funding from the CARES ACT to reimburse
the cost of 816,676 meals served to those in need between March and August 2020.
In support of EDGE focus area 4.0: Efficient Use of Fiscal Capital, all of these wonderful grand and funding
opportunities help us maximize the amount of money that goes back into our classrooms to support student learning.
