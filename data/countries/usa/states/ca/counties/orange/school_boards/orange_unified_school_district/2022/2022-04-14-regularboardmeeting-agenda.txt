Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The Orange Unified School District has 16 individual contractual agreements with Pass-through Redevelopment
Agencies (RDA) within the County of Orange. These program funds are restricted in nature and can only be spent on costs
associated with renovating or improving school facilities. Typically the funds are spent in the area in which they were generated.

address districtwide facility needs and thus serve all students. Over one-third of the students in the district attend schools that
are not their home schools.

District staff recommends that the Board of Education adopt Resolution 24-21-22 which will provide the District with funding
flexibility to implement plans that best address the greatest facility needs and provide the greatest benefit for all district students.

DESCRIPTION: As part of the Measure S Bond Program, the District must complete a process through the County and State, in
accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act, when completing new projects that may affect our school campus
environments and the communities surrounding them.
Project Description (Villa Park High School - Measure S Phase II):
Demolition of existing Building 500 along with associated site and utilities; construction of a new 2-Story (18) General Classroom
Building with Staff Lounge and Meeting Room; associated site work to include underground utilities and landscape
improvements and; accessibility upgrades to the existing Building 100/200 including accessibility upgrades to existing student
restrooms, removal of existing stairs and lift, installation of new stairs and elevator, installation of new fences and gates to secure
the Campus perimeter at Building 100/200 breezeways and upgrades tocampus storm drainage system.
California Environmental Quality Act Compliance:
Projects undertaken by public agencies are subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) as outlined in Public
Resources Code (PRC) Section 21000 et seq. and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code Regulations, Title 14, Section
15000 et seq.). PRC section 21065 defines a project as follows:

Project means an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably
foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment
The proposed modernization improvements at Villa Park High School are a Project under CEQA. Staff has evaluated the Project
in whole and has determined that the proposed improvements are categorically exempt from further environmental review and
the provisions of CEQA under CEQA Guidelines Section 15314. Minor Additions to Schools, which states:
Class 14 consists of minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not
increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less. The addition of portable
classrooms is included in this exemption.
Staff, along with guidance from our CEQA consultant Environmental Audit, has determined that the Project is not subject to any
exceptions to the categorical exemption (CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2). Therefore, the District may file a Notice of
Exemption (NOE) for the Project, which exempts the Project from further environmental review and the provisions of CEQA.
Current Considerations
Adoption of Resolution 27-21-22 which provides the required acknowledgements and findings with respect to the Project at Villa
Park High School to enable the District to:

1. Find the Proposed Project Exempt from CEQA
2. Approve the Filing and Recordation of a NOE
3. Approve the Project, and
4. Authorize staff to file the NOE for the Project with the appropriate public agencies.
Upon approval, the Notice of Exemption will be filed with the County Clerk and the State Office of Planning and Research (OPR).
The filing of a Notice of Exemption with the County Clerk starts a 35-day statute of limitations period on legal challenges to the
agency's decision that the project is exempt from CEQA.

DESCRIPTION:
BACKGROUND
An election was held in the Orange Unified School District (the District) on November 8, 2016 for the issuance and sale
of general obligation bonds of the District for various purposes in the maximum principal amount of $288,000,000 (Measure S).
The District has previously issued a series of bonds under Measure S, and now desires to authorize the issuance of the second
series of bonds under Measure S (the Bonds) in an aggregate principal amount not-to-exceed $100,000,000. The Bonds are
being authorized for sale for the purpose of providing funds to finance projects approved by Measure S and to pay the costs of
issuing the Bonds.
(a) Resolution. The Resolution authorizes the issuance of the Bonds, in one or more series of federally taxable or
federally tax-exempt bonds, specifies the basic terms, parameters and forms of the Bonds, and approves the form of a Notice
Inviting Proposals for Purchase of Bonds, a form of Notice of Intention to Sell, a form of Preliminary Official Statement, and a
form of Continuing Disclosure Certificate, as described below. In particular, Section 1 of the Resolution establishes the maximum
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds to be issued ($100,000,000). The Resolution authorizes the issuance of current interest
bonds only; capital appreciation bonds are not authorized. Section 3 authorizes the bonds to be sold at a competitive sale, and
authorizes Fieldman, Rolapp & Associates, Inc., the Districts Municipal Advisor, and Piper Sandler & Co., the Districts Debt
Advisor, to solicit bids from prospective bidders, and award the sale of the Bonds on the basis of the lowest true interest cost.
(b) Forms of Notice Inviting Proposals for Purchase of Bonds; Notice of Intention to Sell. The Resolution includes as
Exhibits B and C the forms of Notice Inviting Proposals for Purchase of Bonds and Notice of Intention to Sell. The Resolution
authorizes the Districts Municipal Advisor and Debt Advisor to distribute the Notice Inviting Proposals for Purchase of Bonds to
prospective bidders and to cause the Notice of Intention to Sell to be published in the Bond Buyer, a national municipal securities
newspaper, to satisfy applicable legal requirements. The Notice Inviting Proposals for Purchase of Bonds sets forth certain
conditions of closing the transaction, including certain of the documentation to be provided at the closing by various parties.
(c) Form of Preliminary Official Statement. The Preliminary Official Statement (the POS) is the offering document
describing the Bonds which may be distributed to prospective purchasers of the Bonds. The POS discloses information with
respect to, among other things, (i) the proposed uses of proceeds of the Bonds, (ii) the terms of the Bonds (interest rate,
redemption terms, etc.), (iii) the bond insurance policy for the Bonds, if any, (iv) the security for repayment of the Bonds (the ad
valorem property tax levy), (v)information with respect to the Districts tax base (upon which such ad valorem property taxes may
be levied), (vi) District financial and operating data, (vii) continuing disclosure with respect to the Bonds and the District, and (viii)
absence of material litigation and other miscellaneous matters expected to be of interest to prospective purchasers of the Bonds.
Following the pricing of the Bonds, a final Official Statement for the Bonds will be prepared, substantially in the form of the POS.
(d) Form of the Continuing Disclosure Certificate. The form of the Continuing Disclosure Certificate can be found in
APPENDIX C to the POS. Effective July 3, 1995, all underwriters of municipal bonds are obligated to procure from a bond issuer
a covenant that such public agency will annually file material financial information and operating data with respect to the issuer,
as well as notices of the occurrence of certain listed events, through the web-based Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA)
system maintained by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (which is the federal agency that regulates broker-dealers,
including investment bank firms that underwrite municipal obligation issuances). This requirement is expected to be satisfied
annually by the filing of the Districts audited financial statements and other operating information about the District, and from time
to time by the filing of notices of listed events, in the same manner the District has filed in connection with prior bond issuances.
The purpose of the law is to provide investors in the Bonds with current information regarding the District.

Staff recommends approval of Resolution No. 29-21-22 A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION OF THE

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: On March 10, 2022, the Board of Education approved the purchase of six electric school buses awarded by
Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Program (HVIP).In mid-March 2022, the District learned about
another opportunity to apply for the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Program (HVIP) 2022 grant
funding.
HVIP is entering its 12th year as part of the California Air Resources Board's (CARB) heavy-duty funding strategy with over $270
million in funding available. HVIP provides point-of-sale discount vouchers that reduce the purchase cost for zero-emission
school buses. CARB is planning to open and accept new voucher applications in Spring 2022.The applications will open on
March 30, 2022, and will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, based on funding availability after opening. If funding is
oversubscribed, applicants will be selected through a randomized process.
Funding amounts are based on class size of the type of school bus purchased. HVIP is an addition program, which means that
the District is not required to surplus or dispose of buses as part of the grant funding. However, if awarded, the District does plan
to retire some of the diesel-powered school buses that are approximately 25 years old and with high mileage.
RECOMMENDATION: District staff recommends that the Board approve Resolution 30-21-22 authorizing District participation in
the HVIP 2022 grant program.
FISCAL IMPACT:HVIP funds up to $198,000 per bus for zero-emission school buses. The amount of each voucher would be
equal to approximately half the cost of a school bus. The District would be required to pay the remaining balance of
approximately $224,000 per school bus (which includes taxes and options), if awarded.

DESCRIPTION:Effective October 12, 1994, the State of California approved the use of California Multiple Award Schedules
(CMAS) by local governments (i.e., city, county, district, or other local governmental body empowered to expend public funds) for
a wide variety of commodities, including equipment, supplies, materials and services. Using a CMAS contract awarded by the
California Department of General Services (DGS) is a cost-effective manner of procurement for products and services that is
available to school districts. Public Contract Code sections 20118, 10298 and 10299 permit school districts to utilize
competitively bid contracts, including master agreements such as CMAS contracts.
Staff have determined that it is in the best interest of the District to utilize CMAS Contract No. 4-20-00-0085C awarded to
Mohawk Commercial Inc., for the purchase, installation and warranty of floor covering products.

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve CMAS Contract No. 4-20-00-0085C, awarded to Mohawk Commercial
