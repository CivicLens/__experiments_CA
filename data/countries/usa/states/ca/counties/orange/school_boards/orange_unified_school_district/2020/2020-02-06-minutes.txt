  8. INFORMATION / DISCUSSION ITEMS
Information: A. CALIFORNIA STATE MATCHING FUNDS PRESENTATION
Mr. Dave Rivera, Assistant Superintendent/CBO, Business Services presented on the topic of funding and matching funding for school buildings.  He explained Proposition 13, which will be on the ballot and if passed, what the funds will mean to Orange Unified. He answered questions. 
Kris Erickson asked for clarity on the confusion with the past Prop. 13 of 1978 and Mr. Rivera explained. Ms. Erickson asked for the dollar amount that the district would be applying for and clarification on what the dollar amount would mean for Orange USD.  Mr. Ledesma asked for additional clarification and understanding, to ensure that the numbers in the presentation are not currently in the budget.  Mr. Rivera explained that they would be put into a reserve account.  Kathy Moffat spoke to further clarify this item and Proposition 13 due to the confusion with the number, which is due to the "luck of the draw" and the assignment by the state of the number.  She explained that this is how districts get help to improve facilities by the matching funds and that in 2016 there was a resolution passed by the OUSD board to support the matching funds measure Prop. 51.  She explained that now is Orange Unified's turn to benefit from a state measure of matching funds.  She explained what a state wide bond, which does not increase taxes and a general obligation bond that would increase taxes. She explained that it will not raise property tax and the investment that the districts make will then be matched by the state.  She is hopeful that the board will support this proposition, as the benefit to the District is great. Kathy Moffat encouraged all to vote yes on the Proposition 13 to benefit the schools and the community.   Kris Erickson also spoke in support of the measure, as it is an infrastructure bond and non-partisan.  Mr. Rivera reminded everyone of the strict audit regulations on the use of these funds and that there will be accountability, oversight and transparency, if we were to get the funds.   He said this board had previously asked for a commitment that staff would seek external funding whenever possible and staff wishes to show evidence with this presentation, that it is being done.  There was further discussion.

She also asked where the district is on the curriculum regarding the CA Healthy Youth Act. She suggested other board members may have topics as well.  There was further discussion as to dates in March or April.  Kathy Moffat stated the date of February 20 was reserved as a placeholder.  She said there is not enough time to delve into important issues and also stated that board has a tendency to leave things undone.  With additional meetings or study sessions the board could finish the items and understand more fully the programs currently in place.  Board President John Ortega suggested staff may not be prepared for a study session and may need additional time.  Perhaps in April, he suggested. Superintendent Hansen suggested that if this is what the board would like, her office will send out potential dates for study sessions and once there is a consensus, the meeting dates will be calendared with the topics.  March 12 is the next scheduled board meeting.
