4. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
Superintendent Hansen started off by saying it's been a rough week with the school shooting in Texas. She received many emails from parents
and staff members expressing their concerns about the safety of Orange Unified students. We do everything possible to assess the safety
measures and this week she's meeting with Anaheim Chief to see what additional measures can be taken. Later this summer we will set up focus
groups to get input from the community and parents. She encourages everyone to participate in the focus groups. Orange Unified is also looking
for student input. Safety is always first.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Board President Yamasaki started by mentioning the tragic and senseless loss of the innocent school children at Robb Elementary school that
impacts all of us on many levels. She thanked Dr. Hansen and her staff for promptly sending out a message to our school community sharing our
condolences and concerns and reiterating our plans for safe schools.
Mrs. Yamasaki talked about the Orange Unified Community Council of PTA which recognizes individuals or organizations for outstanding service to
children and youth in the community. Orange Unified has extraordinary volunteers and staff and she was happy to see many of them recognized
at the school level and at the council level at the last meeting of the school year. Sonie May and Patty Chau, both from Running Springs and
OUCPTA, received the Honorary Service Award. Michelle Hernandez from OUCPTA and El Modena received the Continuing Service Award. Orange
Unified Transportation Department received the Honorary Service Award and Director Christina Celeste Russo was there to receive the award.
Lastly, OUSD’s Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, Ernie Gonzales received the Outstanding Administrator’s Award.
Mrs. Yamasaki thanked Alan and Tracy Niizawa, former Canyon High School parents, for their generous donations of PA systems, sound
equipment, and musical instruments.
Trustee Page, Trustee Rumsey, and Mrs. Yamasaki attended Orange Unified's first eSports competition. Teams from Villa Park High School and
Orange High School competed in front of a packed audience. Cheerleaders and hundreds of spectators were there to cheer them on. This
extracurricular program gives students who may not be involved in traditional physical sports, an opportunity to form teams and compete. They
work together and collaborate like any other sport. Students use problem-solving skills, and strategic thinking, improve cognitive and social skills

and connect with friends. It was exciting and fun to watch.
Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Trustee Erickson also mentions the school shooting in Texas. We all care about the safety of our students and our staff. We are committed to the
safety of everyone. Orange Unified did a lot of work in response to the Parkland shooting in 2018. A Community Forum on school safety was held
in 2018. The forum is on the website and can be watched. It's good to see how much is done.
Mrs. Erickson paid a visit this week to Frontline Thrift, El Modena Journalism Department’s on-campus pop-up thrift shop. This popular event is
their fifth, forged as a fundraising effort and as Advisor Vicki Mull’s lesson in starting, planning, and running a small business. It’s also a wonderful
way to repurpose and recycle clothes.
Mrs. Erickson congratulated McPherson Magnet School and Villa Park High School, which were the only two public schools in Orange County to be
named Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Distinguished Schools this year! McPherson is one of only 282 schools across the United States. to receive
the honor of PLTW Launch and one of 134 schools for PLTW Gateway. Villa Park High School is one of 196 schools across the U.S. to receive the
honor of PLTW High School.
Mrs. Erickson wished Orange Unified's 2022 Retirees all the best.
Trustee Erickson had the pleasure of attending The Boys and Girls Club of Central Coast Annual Leadership breakfast. They are an incredibly
generous partner in Orange Unified and in speaking with their director and CEO, it was so nice to hear their high praise for Orange Unified as a
partner and for our Administration for being so good to work with. It is a wonderful organization that provides enrichment, equipment, and
programming at several of our elementary schools. They also provide a fully-funded counselor for their College Bound program, which they
administer at two of our high school campuses so far. We heard from a Teen Panel who participated in the program. The College Bound program
mainly serves at-promise youth and first-gen college goers and rests on three pillars – Ensuring all student participants graduate on time, Ensure
all students have a plan for college or career, Ensure all have a plan to pay for their college or career training.With an award of $1.5 million from
the Pacific Life Foundation and other funding, they provide scholarships as well.
Trustee Erickson and Trustee Page visited Ms. Ballestero’s 2nd-grade class at Handy Elementary. Mrs. Page was amazed by the work that second
graders have done in the last year. They attended a social-emotional lesson of students creating a Self Care Toolbox. There were questions
prompted and students were able to add things to help them cope with everyday stressors. Mrs. Page especially liked the model of holding a
classroom meeting to discuss emotions, holding space for everyone to have an equal voice in sharing their concerns, fears, and how they can
work together to ensure everyone feels safe. As children continue to grow, having these social-emotional skills, they will ultimately become more
competent adults being able to effectively communicate and work well with others.
Last week, Mrs. Page attended the banquet Orange High School held for students graduating from Early College Academy. These students have
spent the last 4 years as both high school and college students. It was wonderful to see both teachers and administrators from Orange High
School and Santiago Canyon College supporting our students and their families - many of which are navigating applying for college for the first
time.
Trustee Rumsey talked about the eSports event. It was an exciting event, held in a theater, with a very large screen that had the game projected
while the audience watched. It was like a cross between a play and a football game. The Cheerleaders added to the atmosphere. She thanked the
schools, cheerleaders, and teams. Next year's event will be bigger and better. Mrs. Rumsey also congratulated the high school seniors on their
graduation.
Information: D. Board Recognition – “YOU'VE GOT THE EDGE” – Employee Of The Month Recognition Program
Dr. Hansen introduced Son Tan, Head Custodian at Linda Vista Elementary School, who is the recipient of the "you've got the Edge" - Employee of
the Month award for the month of June. Unfortunately, Mr. Tan was unable to attend tonight. A short video was shown. Board President Yamasaki
read what Linda Vista Principal, Renee Ybarra had to say about Mr. Tan: “Son Tan goes above and beyond in every way. Sonny takes pride in
keeping our campus amazingly clean and does it with a smile. Most of all, Sonny loves our Linda Vista kids! He will routinely connect with
students through soccer or basketball during recess. He encourages them when they are upset. He offers Smarties candies to students and staff
who know the answer to his Friday riddles, and it’s fun to see the students line up to try and solve them! We are so thankful for Sonny's support
in keeping our campus safe and clean and, most of all, for caring about our staff and students. We are lucky to have Sonny Tan as part of the
Linda Vista family.
