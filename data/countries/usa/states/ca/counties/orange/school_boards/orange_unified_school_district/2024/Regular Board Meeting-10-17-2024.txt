In Lieu of Proposition 39 Facilities Use Agreement (First
Amended Agreement) and Amendment A to the In Lieu of
Proposition 39 Facilities Use Agreement (FUA)

Public Content

DESCRIPTION: On August 28, 2024, Orange County Classical Academy ("OCCA") sent a Notice of Termination to the District's
Superintendent, stating that because the City of Orange has made it clear that it would not approve OCCA's planned campus
development on the District's Peralta Site as set forth in the First Amended Agreement, OCCA was providing 30 days' notice that
it was terminating the First Amended Agreement, effective September 27, 2024.
OCCAs Notice of Termination was submitted more than 180 days after the effective date of the First Amended Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the First Amended Agreement, OCCAs notice of termination without cause submitted more than 180
days after the effective date and before January 1, 2025, is effective June 30, 2025, not September 27, 2024.
The District notified OCCA of the effective date of its termination notice, and at the same time proposed Amendment A to the
First Amended Agreement and Amendment A to the Facilities Use Agreement (Amendment A) as a potential means of
terminating the First Amended Agreement more quickly. Per the terms of Amendment A, the First Amended Agreement would
terminate upon approval and execution by both parties, and the prior Facilities Use Agreement (FUA), providing for funding in
lieu of facilities, would be reinstated, but the District would not be obligated to make any payments in lieu of facilities to OCCA for
the 2024-25 school year.
At a meeting on October 3, 2024, OCCAs Board approved Amendment A, which was executed by OCCAs headmaster on
October 4, 2024. The District Boards approval of Amendment A would effectuate early termination of the First Amended
Agreement and reinstate the FUA, except as specified and modified by Amendment A, including eliminating any District
obligation to provide OCCA funding in lieu of facilities for 2024-25. The District administration recommends that the District Board
approve Amendment A in order to effectuate termination of the First Amended Agreement, including terminating any OCCA
rights to use a portion of the Peralta site, as quickly as possible, while also eliminating any requirement that the District make
payments in lieu of facilities to OCCA for the current school year.
FISCAL IMPACT: As per the terms of the First Amended Agreement as modified by Amendment A

Recommended Action :

the item as presented.

Goals :

1.10 Focus Area

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Implementing EduClimber in three selected schools, Panorama, Lampson, and Portola during the 2024-26
school years to enhance our district's ability to make data-driven decisions and provide targeted support to students. EduClimber
is a comprehensive data management platform that consolidates academic, behavioral, and social-emotional data into one
system. This allows educators to identify student needs early, track progress over time, and coordinate interventions more
efficiently.
By using EduClimber in these three schools, we aim to improve the collection, analysis, and application of student data, fostering
a proactive approach to intervention. This initiative will help streamline data management processes, making it easier for school
staff to access actionable insights, collaborate effectively, and personalize instruction based on individual student needs. This
initial implementation will allow us to assess the platform's effectiveness in improving student outcomes before potentially scaling
it district-wide.
Objectives:

1. Streamlined Data Integration: EduClimber will unify multiple data sources (e.g., attendance, assessment, behavior, and
social-emotional learning) into a single platform, allowing for more holistic monitoring of student progress.

2. Informed Decision-Making: School staff will have access to real-time data, enabling quicker identification of students
who need academic or behavioral support.

3. Improved Collaboration: The platform will facilitate enhanced communication and collaboration among educators,
support staff, and administrators, ensuring interventions are coordinated and consistent.

4. Targeted Interventions: With greater insights into student data, educators will be better equipped to design and
implement effective interventions, reducing achievement gaps and promoting equity.
The term is October 1, 2024, through June 30, 2026.
