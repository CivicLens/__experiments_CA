DESCRIPTION:The accountancy firm of Nigro & Nigrowill present information from the 2019-20 audit report. The Education
Code requires that the independent audit be submitted to the State Controllers Office, federal agencies, and the Orange County

The general objectives of an audit are to determine whether: (1) the Districts financial statements are presented fairly in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (2) there is effective district control over and proper accounting for
revenues, expenditures, assets, and liabilities; (3) state and federal reports and claims for advances or reimbursements contain
accurate and reliable financial data and are presented in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements; and (4) state and
federal funds are being expended in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements and those provisions of law or
regulations that could have a material effect on the financial statements and or on the awards that were tested.
The independent audit of the 2019-20 District fiscal records indicates a positive financial status and ongoing maintenance and
improvement of appropriate internal controls. The ending balances for all funds have been verified to be those previously stated
in the Districts Standardized Account Code Structure (SACS) Financial Reporting documents on file with the California
Department of Education and those indicated in the independent accounting system of the Orange County Department of
Education, which maintains ledgers on all payroll, warrant, and financial transactions of any sort of each school district located
