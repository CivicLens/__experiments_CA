B. AUTHORIZATION OF SUBSTITUTE
TEACHER RATES

Meeting :

Dec 15, 2021 - Regular Board Meeting

Category :

8. ACTION ITEMS

Type :

Action

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the proposed adjustment to the substitute teacher rates of
pay effective January 6, 2022.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Board Policy and the District's Certificated Collective Bargaining Agreement require that the District maintain an
adequate pool of substitute teachers in order to ensure sufficient coverage of classes in the event of teacher absences. State
and national organizations are reporting that school districts have been experiencing a significant shortage of substitute
teachers. Many school districts have responded to this shortage by raising substitute teacher rates, thereby increasing the
competition for qualified substitute teachers.
The Districts current rate of pay for substitute teachers was established on September 10, 2015, when the Board of Education
authorized the day-to-day substitute teacher rate of pay to be set at 50% of the daily rate for contracted teachers on step 1,
column 1 of the regular teacher salary schedule. The other rates (long-term, half-day, and per/period) were adjusted to maintain
the established ratio with the day-to-day substitute rate.
Based on current comparable rates for substitute teacher pay in the county and the need to ensure that the District maintains a
sufficient pool of qualified substitute teachers, it is recommended that a second day-to-day rate of substitute teacher pay be
established. The second day-to-day substitute teacher rate of pay (Tier II) would be for certificated substitute teachers who
possess a valid California teaching credential based on a bachelors degree, teacher preparation program, and student teaching;
and would be set at 60% of the daily rate for contracted teachers on step 1, column 1 of the regular salary schedule. The current

day-to-day substitute teacher rate of pay (Tier I) would continue for certificated substitutes who are serving under a 30-day
substitute teaching permit, CTE credential, or other similar document.In addition to the above, it is recommended that the longterm, half-day, and per/period substitute teacher rates be adjusted as follows: all half-day rates to be set at 60% of the full-day
rates; the full-day long-term rates to be set at 22% of the day-to-day full-day rates; the per/period rates to be set at 18.5% of the
full-day rates.
FISCAL IMPACT: 2021-2022: Estimated $68,000 to $102,000 increase
2022-2023: Estimated $45,000 to $68,000 increase (in addition to the 2021-22 increase)
Dependent upon participation from the general fund substitute teacher budget

Motion & Voting
It is recommended that the Board of Education approve the proposed adjustment to the substitute
teacher rates of pay effective January 6, 2022.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Initiatives in California (CENIC) is inviting all California local educational agencies (LEAs), including county
offices of education, school districts, and charter schools to join other California LEAs in the statewide consortium led by CENIC.
Annually, this consortium pursues E-rate discount funding for its connections to the California Research and Education Network
(CalREN). Orange Unified School District utilizes the K12HSN network for internet via the Orange County Department of
Education.
E-rate is a program of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) administered by the Universal Service Administrative
Company (USAC) Schools and Libraries Program (SLP). E-rate provides discounts ranging from 20 to 90 percent on approved
telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connection costs to eligible preschool through grade twelve schools and
libraries. The K12 participation in CalREN is managed by the K12HSN, with the Imperial County Office of Education serving as
the lead agency.
Orange Unified School Districts participation will directly increase funding for the statewide network, thus benefiting all LEAs.
Participation in the CENIC E-rate. Allowing K12HSN and CENIC to name Orange Unified School District as a subscriber will not
affect our ability to apply for and obtain E-rate funding independently. It is recommended that we provide a Letter of Agency so
that K12HSN and CENIC can seek more advantageous rates for internet services.
