DESCRIPTION: At the April 15, 2021, board meeting, the Board approved agenda item 7B, which awarded Bid No. 2021-844 for
district-wide custodial services to Allied Universal Janitorial Services (Allied). The purpose of the bid and subsequent award was
to augment the district's custodial services during the 2021-22 school year.
However, due to the extensive number of absences at both the district and Allied attributed to Covid, Allied is unable to fulfill the
District's needs. To support the sites and keep schools open and safe for students and staff, the District is requesting that the
services of Green Team be approved to augment the Allied contract.
The District has selected Green Team because of past successful working relationships with that vendor. To obtain the required
assistance from Green Team, which is immediately needed, the District is asking that the Board approve the contract with Green
Team in the amount of $200,000, through the use of Emergency Resolution 14-21-22, that the Board passed at the September
9, 2021, board meeting.

DESCRIPTION:Effective October 12, 1994, the State of California approved the use of California Multiple Award Schedules
(CMAS) by local governments (i.e., city, county, district, or other local governmental body empowered to expend public funds) for
a wide variety of commodities, including equipment, supplies, materials and services. Using a CMAS contract awarded by the
California Department of General Services (DGS) is a cost-effective manner of procurement for products and services that is

competitively bid contracts, including master agreements such as CMAS contracts.
Staff have determined that it is in the best interest of the District to utilize CMAS Contract No. 3-21-11-1009 awarded to EKC
Enterprises, Inc., for the purchase, installation and warranty of hardware, software and cloud computing services available under
this contract for district-wide use.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover

assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.
FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The Child Development Services Department offers fee-based school age care through the CARES (Centers for
Afterschool, Recreation, Enrichment and Safety) program at 18 elementary schools. The parent pay program has been in
operation for over 34 years with the objective of providing a cost-effective, high quality program that aligns with Orange Unified
School District's strategic plan goals. Program tuition fees and costs are reviewed and evaluated annually.

A tuition rate adjustment is recommended for the fee-based childcare program for the 2022-23 school year. The rate change is
necessary to continue covering operating costs of the program including ongoing cost of living increases, facility maintenance,
increased costs of field trip admissions, health and safety implementation as well as technology upgrades. The proposed rates
are comparable to similar public and private programs in the community and neighboring districts. Fees will be considered for an
increase approximately every 2 years based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and will be implemented beginning July 1 of the
fiscal year.

up of representative teachers from elementary, middle and high school. In addition, there are site administrators from all school

issues that either directly or indirectly impact the curriculums offered in the Orange USD schools. The Council will make
recommendations to the Superintendent and Board of Education after thoroughly researching and discussing each issue and
potential impact on student achievement. Texts for CTE courses are previously approved by the Central County ROP/Career
Technical Education Partnership (CTEp).
It is at this juncture that the Board of Education places the texts and/or supplementary texts on "30-day review period" so
members from the public may have an opportunity to review those texts, pending formal adoption. The texts are available for
