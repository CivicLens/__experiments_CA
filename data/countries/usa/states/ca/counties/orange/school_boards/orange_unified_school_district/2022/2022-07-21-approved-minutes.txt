4. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
Superintendent Dr. Hansen hoped everybody had some time to relax and enjoy the summer. Dr. Hansen thanked her team as the
district wouldn't have achieved as much as they have without their tremendous support. We continued to offer in-person instruction
the entire year and it was incredible to see the work of our principals and our teachers in the classroom. The schools in the district
won multiple awards like the Golden Bell award for Jordan Academy, making this a total of six golden bell awards in the last five
years. Anaheim Hills Elementary became a National Blue Ribbon School during the pandemic. It's been a challenging time and Dr.
Hansen thanked the Human Resources department for making sure that we do have staffing in place. Dr. Hansen thanked Mr. Rivera
for his tremendous accomplishments in the facilities department with the help of Executive Director Mr. Harvey. Fred Kelly stadium
was constructed during the pandemic as well as the high school STEM centers that opened last year. Students at the high schools
have also been enjoying their new all-weather track and field facilities. On the agenda tonight we have a contract for Mr. Rivera to
become the Deputy Superintendent overseeing both business and facilities Mr. Rivera saved the taxpayers millions of dollars by
refinancing the Measure S loans. She also announced she got emails from parents asking questions about masks. As of now, masks
are still highly recommended in Orange County but not mandated. Parents, students, and employees choose whether they will wear
a mask or not. Since the Uvalda school shooting, there is a lot of focus on safety and security in our schools, and thanks to Mrs.
Corella’s leadership and her educational services team there will be safety forums starting in August. We will be soliciting input from
our parents and employees. The district will hold task force meetings on how to strengthen our security and work together to ensure
that all our employees and our students are safe. We are also partnering with our law enforcement agencies. Information on the
forums will go out soon.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report

the current term of the Employment Agreement for an additional year to June 30, 2025, and recognizes the Superintendent is

evaluation.
In addition, and in recognition of his service, the consent calendar at item 15 F includes the approval of an Employment Agreement
for Mr. David Rivera as Deputy Superintendent for a term of three years, commencing July 1, 2022. Mr. Rivera’s placement on the

service.
In addition, the Consent Calendar provides for approval for a one-year extension of the Agreements for Employment for Assistant

We have a great executive team here. I am proud of the work they have done particularly with the challenges they faced in the last
couple of years. They were proactive and always made the student’s learning and well-being the top priorities. Congratulations on a
positive evaluation from the board!
Since our last meeting, we held over six graduation ceremonies and numerous promotion ceremonies. We heard inspirational and
introspective speeches from our awesome students. The graduation class of 2022 is remarkable in their resilience and fortitude.
Congratulations to all of our graduates and students. Mrs. Yamasaki wished all students well as they are continuing their journey.
Trustee Erickson and Mrs. Yamasaki were happy and excited to participate in the 4th of July parade in Anaheim Hills. It was great to
see students at Canyon High and Fletcher Academy and participate especially during the summer when school is out. They rode in
front of the band and they sounded great. It was fun to be out in the community and see all the families celebrating Independence
day. During the summer, our maintenance crews are busy working on projects that are best done in the summer. Mrs Yamasaki
drives by Canyon High School almost daily and she's happy to see solar shade panels popping up in the canyon parking lot. It is
going fast. About six solar projects are being done over the summer and it's great to see that our district is moving towards clean
energy and renewable energy.
Mrs. Yamasaki is proud of the collaboration with Santiago Canyon College. She got compliments from a parent of an Orange Unified
student that attended three classes. She appreciates the partnership.
Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Board Vice President Erickson mentioned Dr. Hansen earned an incredible evaluation. She thanked Dr. Hansen and her team for their
hard work. Mrs. Erickson commented on the Elementary School Counseling Team for their online resources that can be found on the
Orange Unified website. They list summer break resources and ideas for summer family fun. A lot of people have mentioned they
utilized the resources.
Board Clerk Page mentioned that over the years, Orange Unified has developed strong partnerships with Santiago Community
College and Irvine Chinese School. This summer, Orange Unified had hundreds of students participate in summer programs at the
elementary school sites. Santiago Canyon College offered a variety of courses for Orange Unified students to learn chemistry
through interactive learning such as making slime, and when they want to learn about engineering they build with Legos.
Irvine Chinese school welcomed students from the Fletcher Mandarin Language and Gate Academy. Every week is thematic such as
animals, food, or games and student develop vocabulary while interacting with other children in the Mandarin language. Mrs. Page
hopes many mandarin students are taking advantage of that.
