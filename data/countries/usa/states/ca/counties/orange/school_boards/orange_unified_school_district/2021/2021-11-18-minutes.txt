4. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
Superintendent Hansen started with congratulating Anaheim Hills. She joined board members Ana Page, Andrea Yamasaki and Kris
Erickson in celebrating the National Blue Ribbon celebrations with an assembly and pep rally. A video of the visit was shown. The last
time one of our schools was awarded a Blue Ribbon was in 2012 to Fairhaven. Sycamore followed a couple of years later with a
nomination. Congratulations to all that were involved. This was done during the pandemic, and it shows that Orange Unified kept
serving the community during a pandemic.
Orange Unified have served our community through each challenging stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are pleased to have been
among the schools who were first in the State to return students to full time, in-person instruction while implementing the mandates
of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). With the support of the Orange County Health Officer, Dr. Clayton Chau, we
have been relentless in our focus on the safety of students and staff, and, during this time, we have observed overall minimal
transmission of COVID-19. On October 1, 2021, the Governor issued a press release indicating he would be directing CDPH to
require a COVID-19 vaccination for all K-12 students once the vaccine is fully approved by the Federal Food & Drug Administration
(FDA). At this time, we are aware that this mandate may go into sometime next year but is not currently in effect. There would be
allowances for families to decline vaccination utilizing medical, religious, and personal exemptions. It is important to understand the
challenges these mandates are creating for our school community. Many in our community have significant concerns regarding the
continuance of mask mandates. The introduction of the vaccination mandate has created additional concerns. In listening to our
community, we anticipate the implementation of a vaccination mandate, without an exemption for personal beliefs, will deeply
impact schools and student learning as families leave for independent study programs or other alternatives to classroom-based
instruction. From the very beginning of the response to this pandemic, State regulations have been mandated, placing much of the
burden for communication, implementation, staff, administrators, and school boards. With the responsibility to implement these
mandates, school boards and administrators are left to manage the real frustration of large portions of our public, taking time and
focus away for our critical mission of serving students and supporting teachers and staff. The resulting divisions within some
communities are eroding the trust and partnership that is essential in public schools. We presume that it is the State's intention to
create a supportive structure for public schools, so that more should be done during this very difficult time to support our work

educating children and youth with the two resolutions tonight. In Orange Unified, we believe in the importance of safe, in-person
instruction for our students. All educators have a desire to return to the business of educating our students in the safest and most
normal way. Our students, our educators, and our communities need help and must work together.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Board president Kathy Moffat acknowledged the wide variety of services Orange Unified provides to our students. She visited some
sites this month like the Pre-K program at Crescent Elementary, a school with a wonderful atmosphere where teachers and staff take
such care educating the students with extra needs. At Villa Park High School, Principal Miller took her on a tour and showed some of
the new programs at the school. CTE leads students into different kinds of careers like graphic design, printing, all engaging topics
with very motivated students. A project Lead the Way class was under the leadership of a very impressive teacher we are fortunate
to have in front of our students. At Yorba Middle School, Principal Preciado showed a new dance program with a brand-new room. At
Cambridge Elementary, she met new principal Encheff, who is very grateful for his staff. Sometimes we see just little snippets of our
school district because we are so large, so vast. We have so much we can deliver to our students. She ended by saying how proud
she is of Orange Unified.
Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Board Vice-President Andrea Yamasaki visited Villa Park, Cambridge, McPherson, Handy, Richland, Crescent and Imperial. She saw
the students from Imperial visiting Canyon High school for a tour. She mentioned this is a great opportunity for the students to have
the elementary students see the high school and feel comfortable. She also got a chance to see Canyon Hills and saw their
Halloween celebration. It was such a joy to be there. She looks forward to continuing seeing growth in our district.
Mrs. Yamasaki acknowledged the Anaheim Hills Rotary club. She had an opportunity to speak about the programs at our schools and
give an update on the Measure S. The Rotary offered a grant to teachers.
Board Clerk Kris Erickson was able to visit Serrano, Handy, McPherson, Richland and Jordan. For the first time during her site visits,
students of Serrano, Handy and McPherson Students led the tours. It was impressive how articulated and engaged the students
were. It was unique and they did a fabulous job. Mrs. Erickson also participated in the Dia de los Muertos celebration at Jordan
Academy with dance, songs and story telling. Part of attending a dual immersion school is to not only learn the language but also
the culture. She mentioned that Jordan will receive the Gold Bell Award at the CSBA Conference next month.
Board Member John Ortega talked about the drum line/band competition that was held at Fred Kelly Stadium this month with
Orange High School and El Modena High School participating. For the first time in the history of Orange High School, Drum Line and
Band are moving on to the State Finals. Mr. Ortega applauded the group for the hard work and dedication that is being put into the
program. Mr. Ortega will talk to Dave Rivera about the accessibility for paramedics at the Stadium as that seems to be a problem.
Information: D. State of the School Report: Eliana Lipson- El Modena High School
Superintendent Hansen introduced Principal Katevas and the Rowdy Rooters. In her State of the School Report, Student Board
Member Eliana Lipson from El Modena High School shared a video about events El Modena has been putting on after the tough
school year. The main focus is to reconnect and find out what it means to be in high school. ASB wants the freshman and
sophomores who might not have been on campus before to know what it means to have Vanguard pride and the juniors and seniors
to reconnect and make new memories. Eliana introduced her board and ASB Director Mrs. Rivera.
Information: E. Board Recognition – “YOU'VE GOT THE EDGE” – Employee Of The Month Recognition Program
Dr. Hansen introduced Kristin Cowan, Teacher at Panorama Elementary School, who is the recipient of the "You've got the Edge" Employee of the Month Award for the month of November. Board President Moffat read what the Panorama Staff Administration had
to say about Kristin: "Mrs. Cowan has done an exceptional job of providing opportunities for our scholars in leadership and athletics.
She re-imagined the whole Friday Night Live Student leadership group by creating committees, kindness, increasing school spirit and
connectedness, reinforcing Panther CAREing behavior, and focusing on healthy mental, social, and physical choices. Mrs. Cowan
works with students to empower the scholars to empathetically lead. In addition, she re-booted the anther Running Club after a oneyear hiatus due to COVID-19. The Running club allows students to focus on their physical health, while also promoting a growth
mindset. Each morning she gives up her own time to be out front checking in students and counting running laps". Mrs. Cowan
recognized her family that supported her tonight. Congratulations to Kristin on this honor.
Information: F. Community Partnership Recognition
Principal Misty Brunasso introduced the item. Principal Sandra Preciado introduced the recipient of this quarter: Orange County Gang
Reduction and Intervention Partnership (OC GRIP). The mission of OC GRIP is to prevent at-risk youth in grades 4 through 8 from
participating in street gang activity by promoting and fostering educational and community learning opportunities that assist them
with making positive choices. Orange Unified facilitates six campuses: Handy Elementary, Jordan Elementary, Taft Middle School,
Portola Middle School, Yorba Middle School and Santiago Middle School. Present tonight to accept the award are Orange Police
Department Chief Dan Adams, Orange Police Department Captain Eric Rosauer, Orange Police Department Lieutenant Scott Trausch,
Orange Police Department Sergeant Jude King, Orange Police Department Officer Alex Kovac, Senior Assistant District Attorney Tracy
Miller, Deputy District Attorney Shannon Back, Assistant District Attorney Nicole Nicholson, District Attorney Investigator Jose Flores,
and Waymakers Program Director Kristen Dimeo. Board President Moffat thanked the OC GRIP team for making a difference in the
lives of our students and their families. Orange Police Department Chief Dan Adams stated that the success rate of the program is
amazing and can only be done with the support of the principals and the school staff. Because of this support we're keeping kids out
of gangs.

recommended under the circumstances or that an alternative means of correction would address the conduct: (A) Causing serious
physical injury to another person, except in self-defense. Education Code § 48900.5 Suspension shall be imposed only when other
means of correction fail to bring about proper conduct. However, a pupil, including an individual with exceptional needs, as defined in
Section 56026, may be suspended for any of the reasons enumerated in Section 48900 upon a first offense, if the principal or
superintendent of schools determines that the pupil violated subdivision (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of Section 48900 or that the pupil’s
presence causes a danger to persons or property or threatens to disrupt the instructional process. It is recommended that the Board
of Education uphold the recommendation by Educational Services for expulsion of the student for two semesters, until Fall Semester
2022. Student will return to school of residence with the opportunity to return to a OUSD comprehensive high school after
parent/student consultation with the Office of Student and Community Services.
