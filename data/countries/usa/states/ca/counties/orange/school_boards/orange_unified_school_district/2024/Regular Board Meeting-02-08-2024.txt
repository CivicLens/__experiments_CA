Public Content
DESCRIPTION: The District requested proposals from experienced lease-leaseback firms who have been pre-qualified by the
District in accordance with Education Code Section17406(a)(2)(C), Public Contract Code section 20111.6, and BP 3311, and are
qualified forRFP No. 2324-911Villa Park High School Aquatic Center Project (Preconstruction and Lease-leaseback Services).
The District posted a legal notice calling for proposalstwice in a local newspaper and posted through an electronic bidding portal.
The scope of the Project to be developed during the condition assessment and confirmed with the District during the Schematic
Design Phase is expected to include, without limitation: (a) construction of an aquatic center, including an approximate 6,000
square foot building containing team room, changing rooms/restrooms, coachs office, pool pump room, chemical storage, dry
storage, pool equipment room, ticket/concessions and support areas; (b) sports lighting, scoreboard and memorial wall; (c)
construction of a 50-meter pool; (d) aluminum pre-fabricated bleachers for the capacity of 250 spectators with shade canopy;
and (e) related site work. The District will purchase a Myrtha pool system prior to the construction phase to shorten the
procurement time and save markup costs.
The District received electronic proposals from four firms, which were opened on January 22, 2024. The proposals were
reviewed by Purchasing for mandatory compliance with the RFP requirements and then evaluated by a three-person evaluation
panel to assess each proposer's qualifications and experience relative to the District's needs.

Three firms were then invited for an interview with the evaluation panel and one firm (Neff) was deemed as the overall best value
(best combination of price and qualifications) based on the objective evaluation criteria detailed in the RFP. This bestvalue
competitive procurement process was conducted in accordance with Education Code section 17406 and BP 3311.5.
Based on the entirety of the evaluation process, staff recommends the Board approve the award of RFP 2324-911 Villa Park
High School Aquatic Center Project (Preconstruction and Lease-leaseback Services) to Neff Construction, Inc. and authorize the
preconstruction phase of the project.

Type :

Action

Recommended Action :

It is recommended the Board of Education adopt 2023-2024
Resolution No. 16-23-24, authorizing the Sole Source
Contract with A&TS.p.A./ Myrtha Pools, USA to purchase
Myrtha Pool Products in conjunction with the Villa Park High
School Aquatic Center Project, which includes in its scope of
work the construction of a 50-meter Myrtha pool, for an
amount not to exceed $1,100,000.00.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:To complete work on the Districts Villa Park High School Aquatic Center Project (Project), the District, in
conjunction with PBK Architects, evaluated the Project costs of constructing and maintaining both a 50-meter concrete pool and
a Myrtha pool and determined that installation of a Myrtha pool was the better option.
After a diligent search for additional Myrtha Pool Products vendors, the District has determined that A&TS.p.A./ Myrtha Pools,
USA (Dealer) is the only authorized reseller in the United States for Myrtha Pool products. The courts in California consistently
have held that where competitive bidding works an incongruity and is unavailing as affecting the final result, or where it does not
produce any advantage or it is practically impossible to obtain what is required and observe such forms, then competitive bidding

may be dispensed with and a sole source contract may be entered into. (Graydon v. Pasadena Redevelopment Agency (1980)
104 Cal. App. 3d 631). Public Contract Code section 3400 provides that a district may enter a sole source contract to purchase
products by a specific brand or trade name without competitively bidding on products when the necessary item(s) to be obtained
is only available from one source.
FISCAL IMPACT: County School Facility Fund not to exceed $1,100,000.00

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will offer grant funding through the 2023 Clean School Bus Rebate
Program for clean school buses and zero-emission school buses (electric). The EPA intends to fund at least $500 million. The
grant funding will be available in January 2024 and the deadline to apply is February 14, 2024.

If awarded, OUSD will receive funding for up to $200,000 per bus for zero-emission school buses. In addition, based on the
Board's prior approval, the District participated in and was awarded 14 EV school bus vouchers from the Hybrid Vehicle Incentive
Program (HVIP), which, in aggregate are worth approximately $2.778M. The EPA is allowing grant funding to be combined with
the HVIP vouchers. The District would be responsible for any costs that exceed the two awards, which might include any addons or sales tax. If the District were to receive the maximum award of $200,000 per bus for 14 buses from EPA funding ($2.8M
total) and the District could apply both the EPA funding and HVIP vouchers, the district would be responsible for an additional
$1.148M (approximately $82,000 per bus).
RECOMMENDATION: Staff recommends the Board of Education approve Resolution 20-23-24 authorizing the Deputy
Superintendent or designee to work with a third party in submitting the application for EPA funding and accept the funds, if
awarded, and authorizes the use of $1.148M of the transportation grant to acquire the buses.
