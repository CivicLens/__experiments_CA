response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the local educational agencies ability to conduct meaningful annual planning, and the
ability to meaningfully engage stakeholders in these processes. EO N-56-20 issued timeline and approval waivers for the Local
Control and Accountability Plan and Budget Overview for Parents as well as waving certain budgetary requirements. The
Executive Order also established the requirement that a local educational agency (LEA) adopt a written report (COVID-19

school closures to address the COVID-19 emergency and the major impacts of such closures on students and families.

A description of the steps that have been taken by the LEA to provide school meals while maintaining social distancing practices.
A description of the steps that have been taken by the LEA to arrange for supervision of students during ordinary school hours.
The COVID-19 Operations Written Report must be adopted by the local governing board or body in conjunction with the adopted
annual budget by July 1, 2020.

DESCRIPTION: Under AB 1808, the Governor required that all Special Education Local Plan Areas (SELPAs) develop a Local
Plan that conformed to a template provided by the California Department of Education (CDE). The template was intended to
provide the public with a format that would be uniform across the state. A Local Plan committee was formed in the Orange
SELPA. The Local Plan in the new format was developed, reviewed, and recommended. The Local Plan brought forward for
approval contains all required and updated sections, aligned with the language inCDEs template of the Local Plan. Upon
approval, the Local Plan will become the interim plan pending CDE approval. CDE requires each SELPAto submit their Annual
Budget and Annual ServicePlan to the Board of Education for approval and adoption. This public hearing enables the Orange
SELPA to comply.
FISCAL IMPACT: Funds are received from state and federal special education grants.

Meeting :

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education hold a
public hearing and subsequently adopt the 2019-20
Estimated Actuals and the 2020-21 Budget.

Goals :

4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Effective 2014-15, Education Code section 52062(b)(2) requires the school district governing board to adopt its
budget at a public meeting. This meeting shall be held after, but not on the same day as, the public meeting at which the
governing board holds the required public hearing. State Executive Order N-56-20 dated April 22, 2020, postponed the deadline
for adoption of the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) to December 15, 2020. This delay uncouples the LCAP from the
adopted budget for 2020-21. The Executive Order does not waive the requirement to hold a public hearing and adopt the district
budget by July 1.
Average Daily Attendance: The 2020-21 Budget is constructed on the following student population:
ADA

OUSD

23,192.94

Non-Public Schools

42.10

Community Day School

20.24

SB 1446 declining enrollment protection

211.82

County Special Education

County Community Schools

98.06

Sub-Total

23,579.28

El Rancho Charter MS

1,124.18

Santiago Charter MS

981.65

Sub Total (Charter Schools Only)

2,105.83

GRAND TOTAL

25,685.11

The total budgeted attendance of 23,255.28 (not including District charter schools, county special education, county community
schools, and SB1446 declining enrollment protection) reflects an anticipated decline of 583.43 in District ADA. District charter
schools ADA of 2,105.83 reflects a decline of 38.99 as compared to the prior year.
Revenues: The following chart shows the driving factors of the LCFF in addition to ADA:
Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)

2.29%

Transitional Gap Funding

100.00%

3 Year Rolling Unduplicated English Learner (EL), Free/ Reduced (F/R) and Foster Youth (FY)
Student Percentage

50.88%

Until the state adopts its 2020-21 Budget, the proposed funded LCFF yields an estimated $2,292,169 decrease as compared to
the prior year primarily due to the COLA.
Most state categorical entitlements and grants known to be ongoing are projected at current levels. Only special education
AB602 funding is expected to receive the 2.29% COLA. No increase is anticipated for ongoing federal programs in this adoption.
Interest earnings are projected at 2% and the lottery is estimated at $207 per student ($153 unrestricted, $54 restricted by
Proposition 20).
Staffing: Certificated staffing is based upon a ratio of 30:1 for grades TK-6: 32:1 for grades 7-12. Salaries include step/column
increases for certificated employees and step/range increases for classified employees. Statutory benefits (STRS, PERS,
Workers Compensation, etc.) are driven by payroll costs. Health benefits are based on current employer contribution levels.
Expenditures: Supplies, services/operating expenses, and capital outlay are in conformity with the estimated site and program
budgets.
The estimated unexpended entitlements have been included in components of the 2019-20 ending fund balance and added to
the 2020-21 budget expenditure lines. The estimated unexpended entitlements include: Medi-Cal Billing Option, Mental Health,
Huber Trust, Low Performing Student, and Classified Employee Professional Development Block Grants of approximately $1.7
million.

Other unexpended/remaining components of the 2019-20 ending fund balance are non-resident tuition, site/department
donations and program carryover, Credential Support Contracts, Textbooks, STRS/PERS Increases and school site Lottery
allocations of approximately $ 15.2 million; these estimated unexpended items are included in the 2020-21Budget expenditure
lines, except for the STRS/PERS Increases, Textbooks and program carryover, which remain as assignments of the ending
balance.
Ending Balance: The projected ending balance of $57,165,717 comprises the following:

Revolving Cash

$100,000

Stores

$150,000

Non-resident Tuition

$84,295

Textbooks and program carryover

$5,525,000

Attract & Retain Students (One-Time Mandated Cost)

$4,049,343

STRS/PERS Increases

$1,341,560

Reserve for Economic Uncertainties

$9,315,060

Unappropriated Amount (Above 3%)

$36,600,459

The ending balance meets the State-required three-percent reserve, and the 2020-21 Budget complies with the AB 1200
accountability guidelines as set forth by the State of California.
Unaudited actuals for 2019-20 and budget revisions for 2020-21 resulting from actual carryover and the adoption of the State of
California budget will be presented to the Board of Education at its September 10, 2020 meeting.
The First Interim Report is scheduled for December 17, 2020. The Second Interim will be presented in March 2021.
The Board of education recognizes that the District was deficit spending for 2020-21 through 2022-23 fiscal years by
approximately $25 million primarily due to continuous enrollment decline, increasing contributions to STRS and PERS employee
pensions, and rising contributions for unfunded mandates in Special Education and Transportation Programs. In addition, due to
the COVID 19 Pandemic, Governor Newsom has identified a multi-year budget shortfall of $54 billion for the State in his most
recent May Revise Report. Consequently, the Governor is planning on reducing the level of education funding by $19 billion. The
Governor is working closely with the Speaker of the House supporting the passing of a Federal Stimulus package that will
support education, named the Heroes Act. If this legislation were to pass, then the Governors proposed reductions to the
education budget, of approximately $20 million to Orange Unified, would be greatly reduced.
In submitting the 2020-21 Adopted Budget, the Board understands its fiduciary responsibility to maintain fiscal solvency for the
current and subsequent two fiscal years. Due to the following reasons: a) economic uncertainty as a result of the CoronaVirus
(COVID-19) Pandemic, b) volatility of state general fund revenues, c) declining enrollment, and d) increasing operational
expenses; it is recognized that, if necessary, the school district plans to implement ongoing budget reductions in 2020-21 and in
the subsequent year to maintain fiscal solvency. With the 2020-21 First Interim report submission, the Board will provide a
detailed budget stabilization plan along with an implementation timeline.
The 2019-20 Estimated Actuals and the 2020-21 Budget are available for public inspection at the Districts Business Service
Office.
FISCAL IMPACT: The fiscal impact to the various funds is shown in the State budget documents.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: On March 17, 2019, the Board of Education authorized a Master Architectural Agreement with LPA Architects,
Inc., to provide design and construction administration services for the Measure S Program Villa Park High School Science
Center project.
During the current planning process for Measure S Phase II, it was determined that drainage needs to improve before an
additional building can be constructed on campus. The Measure S Architect of Record, LPA Architects, has proposed to design
the drainage improvements for both Phase I and Phase II for a lump sum of $90,000 (construction estimated at $1,200,000).
Construction on the site improvements would beginin Phase I and continue with the new classroom building in Phase II. An
additional amount of $10,000 will be added for reimbursable expenses. The proposed scope of work and cost were reviewed by
the District's Program Management team from Cumming and was found to be consistent with the Master Architectural
Agreement fee schedule for construction administration services.
The contract total, inclusive of reimbursable expenses and all amendments, will increase from $2,645,936 to $2,745,936.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Ellevation Education is the English Learner student tracking information and instructional design software utilized
specifically for English Learners. Ellevation allows districts to meet compliance requirements, and also provides instructional
achievement tracking for English Learners. One much-needed component of the Ellevation product is the usability to reclassify
and track the progress and status of current English Learners and the reclassified English Learner population. Reclassified
students must be tracked for four years, which creates a large amount of paper communication. Ellevation software stores all the
names of these students in their student data base, and is able to send teachers electronic forms to complete for the
reclassification monitoring compliance. This is all done with a few clicks and stored electronically.
Ellevation syncs with the District's Aeries system, so that student information is retrieved easily. Ellevation can also be coded to
automatically reclassify students when provided the requirements. Currently, this is performed by hand by Language
Assessment Clerks. This product will allow the Language Assessment Center to move into the 21st Century via digital
automaticity. This annual renewal will include the basic CA Bundle, data and implementation services, and in-person
professional development.
FISCAL IMPACT:Fiscal impact will be the expenditure of restricted categorical fund monies.
