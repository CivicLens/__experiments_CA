Action: D. BOARD POLICY REGARDING PARENT/GUARDIAN BILL OF RIGHTS
Public comments:
Frank Rodriguez: his office has conducted two independent investigations and found two violations that infringed upon parental rights:
planned parenthood on campus and parents were not notified and an illegal survey was embedded in the curriculum without parental
notification.
Jolin Lang, OUSD parent: finds it strange that the Parental Bill of Rights is on the agenda. All is already available or all done. You already
have access, this is a stunt. Is this a way to go through libraries and classrooms to remove what others find offensive?
Marci Strange: Governor Newson wants to take away parents' rights. Vote for this Bill of Rights.
Joette: No grooming and no Planned Parenthood.
Tanya, OUSD parent: does not want the Bluest Eye in the school libraries. It has sexual content.
Karin Barone, OUSD parent: All items on Parental Bill of Rights are all in policies. It's political theater. Sometimes teachers need
supplemental resources when adopted textbooks don't adequately address the standards we need to teach. Teachers must have the

professional right, respect, and academic freedom to use materials without having to post them first.
Linda Horist: stands behind every single curriculum. Vote for recall.
Rosita Otero: In support of the Bill of Rights. Parents need to be part of the discussion.
Kelly: parents need to see what is thought as well as curriculum standards and changes. Somebody needs to stand up for parents.
Julie Gentle: parents have a right to know what is in the curriculum and in the library. She supports the Bill of Rights.
Scott Resnick, OUSD parent: Support the parental rights but not the version as presented. There is no transparency about the process
and no parental involvement. Rules are vague and confusing.
Kim VanDerHoek, OUSD parent: never lost a right in all years kids were enrolled. All curriculum is on the website. Agrees with Mr.
Resnick.
Soren Williams, OUSD parent: is not against the Bill of Rights but this copy-paste of the California Policy Center playbook. It lacks input
from the community. It's already in a lot of places. This shows the majority does not know what is going on in the district.
Missy: Who has authority over children? State, School, parents? Parents hold ultimate authority over children. Support this policy. It will
protect students and parents.
Betty Chu: rights are the protection of education.
Daniel: thanks for implementing. Rights have been ignored in this district. Also wants a student bill of rights.
Lori Keeler: supports parents' rights.
Lynne Muslin: Cultural shift towards Marxism. Family rights are being attacked.
Mary: supports Parental Bill of Rights. We have to tolerate the sex curriculum and she doesn't agree with it.
Heidi Claire: parents have been under attack including by the teachers' union. They put their political agenda before children.
Gregory Pleasants, OUSD parent: loves the teachers and is an involved parent. Those board members that propose the Bill of Rights don't
have kids in our district and their supporters only bring hate and homophobia.
Heather Punek: is a concerned parent. Districts and parents need to work together. Mental healthcare needs to be included.
Melanie Polack, OUSD parent: we already do have everything that is in the bill. Nothing new and not necessary. We need to improve our
elementary schools. Follow the master plan.
Eva Harrison: parents are not the enemy. Parents, staff, and children should be on the same bill. Look at the Chino Bill of Rights.
Pastor Rod Schorr: we need the parent's rights in the school and protect our children. The issue is the sexualization of the children.
Chris Merritt: concerned about the fear in the room. Kids need support. Don't take books out of the library. Children might see and
identify themselves. Not all kids have support at home.
Sapna Chopra, OUSD parent: is an involved parent, and teachers always responded and made her feel welcome. The Bill is redundant.
She has already experienced all those rights.
Sonia Anderson, OUSD parent: Her child was sexually harassed and it took time to get somebody to listen. She will keep fighting.
Eileen McDermott: God is the ultimate authority. Supports the Bill.
The trustees engaged in a discussion.
Trustee Ledesma stated consolidation of several items to one page was needed. Trustee Miner commented that this will help students
and parents. Trustee Erickson suggested going over the items we already have. This is political theater as most are already in policies.
Trustee Erickson asked for additional rights:
The district will ensure to Parents/Guardians that their children have equitable access to a full library of age-appropriate books to satisfy
the diverse needs and interests of all types of students, and that the First Amendment rights of all students are protected.
The District will provide Parents/Guardians the right to advocate for their student(s) in their native language
The District will provide Parent/Guardian assurance that students’ rights under state and federal law are protected and that any and all
harassment, bullying, or disciplinary procedures and protocols are displayed on their website
Also, add to the second bullet point in section 1: And the District will follow all state laws with regard to academic content and standards
Trustee Yamasaki stated that any parent was able at any time to come to the district and look at the curriculum, that any items are
already in the board policies, and that a second reading is needed. Trustee Page mentioned that when she enrolled her child, all policies
were available. She agreed on having one page but wants a second reading, and the ability to add. Trustee Ortega stated that access is
not easy and that he is careful with data mining. Parents need to have a right to know where student data is used for. Opt-out should be
better available. The curriculum must be shown online, and streamlined for easy accessibility. Trustee Rumsey mentioned that we are all
in agreement with supporting parents' rights and that we can do that with this bill.
It is recommended by Trustees Ledesma and Miner that the Board of Education adopt a board policy regarding Parent/Guardian Bill of
Rights with the changes from Trustee Erickson. In a discussion trustee Ledesma stated there is no need for adding. The policy can be
brought back by Trustee Erickson.

Muslin; Daniel; Michelle Morgan; Aeron Washington; Heidi Claire; Linda Pillsbury; Sonia Grean; Heather Puheck; Eva Harrison; Eileen
McDermott, Heidi Claire, Alejandra.
David Dufault: Now is not the time for decisive debates. This is a nonissue.
JJ Meis, OUSD parent: Act of theater to use your name on an agenda item.
Jessica Nettles, OUSD parent: There are always US and California flags in our schools. This is just stirring the pot. Making more division.
Gregory Pleasants, OUSD parent: Loves the flag. Loves what it stands for. Equal protection. The subtext here is hate.
Motion by John Ortega to end the meeting at 12:00 am, second by Angie Rumsey.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Andrea Yamasaki, Kris Erickson, Ana Page, Rick Ledesma, John Ortega, Angie Rumsey, Madison Miner

Motion by Andrea Yamasaki, second by Angie Rumsey.
The trustees engaged in a discussion. Legal counsel stated it's changing the verbiage but with the same intent. Acting Superintendent
explained that some verbiage of the Administrative Regulation would be moved to the Board Policy: Only US and California flag and add
prominently displayed in classrooms.

Yea: Andrea Yamasaki, Kris Erickson, Ana Page, Rick Ledesma, John Ortega, Angie Rumsey, Madison Miner
