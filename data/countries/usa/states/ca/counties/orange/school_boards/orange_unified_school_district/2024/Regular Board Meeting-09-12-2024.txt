Throughout the school year, Educational Services staff will work with the student representatives to facilitate communication
between the Board and the students of this District. Student Board Members are expected to attend all regular school Board

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:September is Attendance Awareness Month, and as students are welcomed back to school, our District proudly
emphasizes the collective effort that has led to significant strides in improving student attendance over the past two school years.
This progress has been made possible through the implementation of a comprehensive Student Attendance Process and the We
Champion Attendance initiative, a testament to our shared commitment to student success.
The message is that our students will learn and succeed in the classroom when the barriers to attendance are removed, good
attendance patterns are established at a younger age, and schools
actively celebrate success in punctuality and improved attendance.
Attendance improves when schools closely monitor chronic absences and engage in personalized early outreach and student
support. These collective efforts have led to a notable 3.4% reduction in chronic absenteeism at the end of the 2022-23 school
year. We anticipate a 2.6% reduction in chronic absenteeism when the California Department of Education releases the School
Dashboard in December 2024. This focused approach has positively impacted student behavior and resulted in an impressive
13.5 million instructional minutes increase.
As we continue to build on these accomplishments, we remain dedicated to sustaining this momentum and further reducing
barriers to student attendance. Together, we can ensure that every student has the opportunity to achieve their full potential.
Thank you for your ongoing commitment to this vital work. Lets continue to champion attendance and celebrate the success of
our students!

DESCRIPTION:September 30th is recognized as International Translation Day, and the District wishes to honor the vital
contributions of our interpreters by designating this day as Interpreter Appreciation Day. As our school year progresses, it is

essential to acknowledge the role that interpreters play in ensuring that every student and family, regardless of their language
background, can fully engage in the educational process.
The recognition of International Translation Day provides a meaningful opportunity to highlight the value of effective
communication in our schools. By removing language barriers and promoting inclusivity, our interpreters ensure that all students
have equitable access to education and resources, fostering a supportive and collaborative learning environment.
Interpreters enhance the educational experience by facilitating clear communication between families and school staff, promoting
cultural understanding, and ensuring that every voice is heard. Their work is integral to the Districts mission of providing a highquality education to all students and supporting their academic success.
The theme for this years International Translation Day, "Translation, an Art Worth Protecting," emphasizes the critical role of
interpreters in preserving the integrity and cultural significance of communication in our diverse community. By closely engaging
with families and providing personalized support, interpreters help to build strong relationships that contribute to student success.
The Board of Education will adopt the proclamation declaring September 30th as "International Translation Day" in recognition of
the dedication, skill, and impact of our interpreters.

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education take action to
adopt the proposed resolution approving the renewal petition
for El Rancho Charter School (El Rancho) pursuant to
Education Code Sections 47605 and 47607 for a seven-year
term to be effective July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2032

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: The Orange Unified School District received a charter school renewal petition (Charter) from El Rancho on June
17, 2024. On July 18, 2024, the Board of Education held a public hearing on the El Rancho renewal Charter, pursuant to
Education Code Section 47605. A copy of the renewal Charter has been maintained for public review at the District Education
Center. Education Code Section 47607 provides that a charter granted by a school district governing board may be renewed one
or more subsequent times by that entity.
Pursuant to the Charter Schools Act of 1992, as an additional criterion for renewal, charter schools are now divided into high,
middle, and low-performing or Dashboard alternative status schools. The pertinent renewal standards and the available length of
the renewal term are dependent on this categorization. (Ed. Code §47607 and 47607.2.) El Rancho has been designated on the
California Department of Educations charter school performance category list as a high performing charter school for purposes of
this renewal request, so may be renewed for five to seven years.
District staff and legal counsel have reviewed El Ranchos renewal Charter. Based upon this review and considering the
standards and requirements applicable to El Ranchos renewal as a high-performing charter school, District staff have found that
the renewal Charter meets the criteria for renewal as outlined in Education Code Sections 47605 and 47607. In accordance with
the requirements of Education Code Section 47605, Districts staffs recommendations and recommended findings on the renewal
Charter were published 15 days prior to the District Boards scheduled action on the renewal request, on August 28, 2024.
Education Code Section 47605 provides that the Board of Education shall either grant or deny the Charter renewal within 90
days of receipt of the petition. Accordingly, this item is before the Board for action on September 12, 2024, which is within the 90day window as provided by law.
FISCAL IMPACT: Upon review of the charter school renewal petition, no significant changes in fiscal impact have been
determined.

DESCRIPTION:Public Contract Code Section 10298 allows the State to consolidate the needs of multiple state agencies for
goods, information technology, and services, and to establish contracts, master agreements, multiple award schedules,
cooperative agreements, including agreements with entities outside the state, and other types of agreements that leverage the
states buying power. Local agencies may contract with suppliers awarded those contracts without further competitive bidding
upon the same terms and conditions agreed to by the State.

DESCRIPTION: On November 16, 2023, the Board of Education approved the purchase of Gatekeeper camera equipment to
improve student and bus driver safety and security on all school buses. Gatekeeper cameras offer superior performance and
features. The interior cameras record with infrared technology in no-light conditions, are equipped with microphones to clearly
record audio, and can capture views in between high-back seats. The exterior cameras provide 360-degree coverage for blindspot detection on the transit buses, and front-dash and rear-view cameras allow clearer views around the school buses. The
recorded footage will automatically download wirelessly when the school buses pull into the transportation bus yard, reducing the
transfer time and helping to speed up the review process.
Gatekeeper Systems, Inc. provides annual hosted services which include hosting the server, 1TB of cloud storage, and a weekly
health check report of all camera equipment on the school buses. Staff recommends the hosted services provided by
Gatekeeper Systems, Inc. to maintain the quality of the systems procured.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The Gann Amendment provides a ceiling, or limit, on each year's appropriations of tax dollars by each taxreceiving agency, including the state, cities, counties, school districts, and special districts. Proposition 4, an initiative passed in
November 1979, added controls on the growth in appropriations (Article XIII-B of the California Constitution). Using 1978-79 as a
base year, subsequent year appropriations limits have been adjusted for: (1) An inflation increase equal to the change in the
Consumer Price Index, or per capita personal income, whichever is smaller, and (2) the change in the population, which for
school agencies is the change in Average Daily Attendance (ADA). Proposition 111 was adopted in June 1990 and amended the
Gann Limit inflation factor to be based only on the change in per capita personal income.
The starting point for the 2024-25 Gann Limit calculation is the agency's 2023-24 Gann Limit which has increased by this year's
inflation factor and by the District's percentage increase in ADA. A second calculation is made to determine those revenues that
are subject to the limit and ensure that a school agency is not over its limits.Not all revenue sources count against the District's
Gann Limit. Gann Limits only constrain the appropriations from state and local tax sources, and so federal aid is excluded as well
as non-tax income, such as revenues from cafeteria sales or adult education fees. It is by virtue of this calculation that almost
every school district and county office of education's expenditures are exactly at theirGann Limit. Orange Unified School District
is no exception.
In accordance with Article XIII-B of the California Constitution, a resolution must be adopted annually regarding the
appropriations limit for current and preceding fiscal years. Approval of this resolution will fulfill that requirement.
RECOMMENDATION: It is recommended the Board of Education adopt Resolution No. 05-24-25: Gann Amendment
Appropriations Limit, for the current and preceding fiscal years in accordance with Article XIII-B of the California Constitution.
FISCAL IMPACT:This item has no fiscal impact on the district. (Holguin/Bulsara)

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: On December 15, 2020, the Board of Education approved the Transportation Department to work with Southern
California Edison (SCE) to install electric vehicle charging station infrastructure through the Charge Ready Transport (CRT)
Program.The first phase infrastructure process was completed in February 2022, which allowed the District to acquire 15 19.2kW
AC Level 2 charging stations. These charging stations are equivalent to slow chargers and can take approximately 6-8 hours to
fully charge one bus.
On July 21, 2022, the Board of Education approved the Transportation Department to work with the SCE CRT Program for the
second phase to upgrade and expand the existing electric vehicle charging station infrastructure. SCE approved the
Transportation Department to acquire 16 additional electric vehicle charging stations (13 19.2kW AC Level 2 and 3 60kW DC
Level 3 fast chargers). The DC Level 3 charging stations take approximately 3-4 hours to fully charge one bus. This combination
is unique to phase two of the infrastructure process through the SCE CRT Program and beneficial to the efficient operation of the
Transportation Department. Secondphase construction is currently taking place with an expected completion date in Fall 2024.
On June 13, 2024, the Board of Education accepted the grant award of 17 electric vehicle school buses through the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As necessitated by this grant, the Transportation Department will need to apply with
SCE through the CRT Program for the third phase to upgrade and expand the existing electric vehicle charging station
infrastructure. During this phase, the Director of Transportation will work with SCE to incorporate approximately 10 electric
charging stations, all of which will be DC Level 3 chargers ranging from 60kW to 125kW. The 125kW charging stations take
approximately 1-2 hours to fully charge one bus.
RECOMMENDATION:District staff recommends the Board of Education approve Resolution 06-24-25 authorizing the Director of
Transportation to participate in the SCE CRT Program (grant funding) and submit an application for the third phase to upgrade
and expand the existing electric vehicle charging station infrastructure.
FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact on the district at this time.

DESCRIPTION: TransTax Advisors is an attorney-led tax consulting firm focused on recovering and reducing the burden of
indirect taxes imposed at the federal, state, and local levels for businesses and organizations with transportation and logistics
operations. TransTax Advisors focuses on federal clean energy tax credits pertaining to motor fuels, charging infrastructure,
electric vehicles, and sales and excise taxes. Additionally, electric school buses acquired with federal grant funding do not
disqualify a school district from receiving tax credits. The lead time is approximately 9-12 months to receive the IRS tax credits.
TransTax Advisors will assist with the registration process and/or eligibility review, prepare claims, and provide support through
the audit defense process.
Three potential opportunities are identified below to help the District receive tax credits.

1. Electric Vehicle (EV) Bus Tax Credits For any EV buses placed into service after January 1, 2023, and which were not
fully covered by grant funding, theres a tax credit up to $40,000/bus.
a. Eight (8) buses were placed into service after that date and which were not fully covered by outside funds.
b. The IRS registration deadline for 2023 buses is in October.
2. Infrastructure There is a tax credit of 30% of cost up to $100,000 per property for both EV charging and expansion of the
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) infrastructure.
a. TransTax Advisors will help the District verify and validate several qualificationsbefore pursuing an IRS tax credit
claim.
b. The IRS registration deadline for 2023 infrastructure is in October.
3. Alternative Fuel Theres a tax credit worth $100,000 for the Districts CNG usage.
a. The next filing deadline is to be determined.
Staff recommends the District consult with TransTax Advisors for professional expertise in receiving IRS Clean Energy Tax
Credits for EV and alternative fuel usage, and EV and CNG charging infrastructure usage.
FISCAL IMPACT: TransTax Advisors credit services will be invoiced separately, determined by the amount of gross savings
received by the District. Invoices are sent after the District deposits savings from tax credits received. The fee for tax recovery
services will be based on the complexity of the issues addressed and the expertise required. All fee structures are negotiable
and TransTax Advisors will discuss fee reduction options with the District. TransTax Advisors will typically charge a fee of 25%
for the services listed above, but if the District engages in multiple issues, the fees may be reduced to approx. 20% for EVrelated tax credits and 17.5% for CNG-related tax credits, which amounts to a 20% and 30% discount, respectively. (Holguin

B. Teacher Assignment/Consent - Variable or ShortTerm Waiver

Meeting :

Category :

12. CONSENT ITEMS - HUMAN RESOURCES

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable-term. Short-term waivers give the districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term needs.
This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential authorization for
one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover assignments
when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while searching for an
individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It also allows the
individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

FISCAL IMPACT:This item has no fiscal impact on the district.
