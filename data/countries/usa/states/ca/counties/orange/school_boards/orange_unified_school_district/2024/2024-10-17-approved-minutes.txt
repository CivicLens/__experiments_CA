Teacher in the Fletcher Elementary CARES program.
Principal, Julie Lucas, had this to say about Susan: Susan spends countless hours preparing for the success of her Home School
Students. She creates trusting and productive relationships with families and ensures they feel heard and supported. She has
been the teacher for the Home School Program since its inception and has promoted it, worked to improve it, and has done it
justice! She is truly the heart of the soul of the program and is the epitome of what makes Parkside so special. Ms. Kissee truly
loves her job, and it shows every day in all her interactions. We are proud to have her as a part of the Titan family!
Jaime Beidler, Coordinator of Expanded Learning, shared the following about Matthew: Over the past five years, Matthew has
demonstrated remarkable personal and professional growth, fully embracing the values of our program. His commitment to

Information: E. International "Walk to School Month"
Executive Director Student & Community Services Heriberto Angel presented the item. He shared that OUSD participated in the
Walk to School Day on October 2nd, 2024 because:
• It is fun! Starting your school day with a walk is an opportunity for students and families to begin the day with enthusiasm.
Walk to School Day also builds connections between students, families, and their environment.
• It encourages safety. It's an opportunity to teach and reinforce safe walking behavior while bonding as a family.
• It promotes physical activity. Starting the school day with a walk is one of the easiest ways to get the daily physical activity
that kids need to be healthy.
• It is good for learning. Research shows that walking helps overall learning. Students start the school day alert and ready to
learn.
• It helps reduce traffic congestion. More kids on foot with their families means fewer cars on the road. Fewer cars on the road
results in less traffic congestion around the school zone and neighborhood.
