Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and the Local Control and Accountability Plan
(LCAP) regulations require that each districts LCAP public hearing be held in advance and at a separate meeting prior to the
LCAP adoption. The intent of the LCAP hearing is to allow for public comment and recommendations regarding the specific
actions and expenditures proposed to be included in the LCAP and budget (Education Code 52062(b)). Further, the regulations
require that the public hearing for budget be held at the same meeting as the public hearing for the LCAP.
The development and adoption of the LCAPis aState-mandated strategic planning process for districts across the State of
California.Actions and services identified in the eight state priorities are directly aligned to LCFF funding.
The contents of the LCAP has been shared with the Superintendents District Advisory Council (DAC), District English Learner
Advisory Committee (DELAC), and various engaged community partners meetings. An intensive community engagement
process beginning in January2022 resulted in continuous refinement of the LCAP actions and services through use of surveys,
focus group meetings, and consultation with the employee associations.
The publication notification for the 2021-2024Year Two Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) public hearing was placed
in the Orange County Register.The LCAP and budget document is available for public inspection at the District Administrative
Offices.
It is recommended that the Board of Education hold a public hearing and receive public comment on the 2021-2024Year Two
LCAP.

Recommended Action :

Goals :

4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Proposition 98 regulates school district funding. In 2014, Proposition 2 was passed limiting the levels for
Proposition 98 reserves. If the state reserve levels exceed 3% of the total Proposition 98 expenditures for TK-12, that triggers a
10% cap on local district reserves. If a district has reserve funds exceeding 10%, the overage must be designated for other
purposes, with those purposes specified for the Board to review and approve through a resolution. The 2021-22 state budget act
triggered the reserve cap. Thus, the District, through Resolution 39-21-22, is providing a list of designated uses for the overage
for the Board's approval.

FISCAL IMPACT: None.

Public Content
ESCRIPTION:Education Code sections 42127 and 52062 require the school district governing board to adopt its budget at a
public meeting. This meeting shall be held after, but not on the same day as, the public meeting at which the governing board
holds the required public hearing. The adoption of the proposed budget is scheduled for the June 2, 2022, board meeting.
Average Daily Attendance:The 2022-23 Budget is constructed on the following student population:
ADA
OUSD

22,509.01

Non-Public Schools
29.64
Community Day School
6.47
County Special Education
6.31
County Community Schools
52.48
Sub-Total
22,603.91
El Rancho Charter MS
1,038.72
Santiago Charter MS
1,024.01
Orange County Classical Academy
509.18
Sub Total (Charter Schools Only)
2,571.91
GRAND TOTAL
25,175.82
The total budgeted attendance of 22,545.12 (not including District charter schools, county special education, and county
community schools) reflects an anticipated decline of 355.96 in District ADA. District charter schools ADA of 2,571.91 reflects an
increase of 130 as compared to the prior year due to estimated grade span expansion for Orange County Classical Academy
and increased P-2 ADA for Santiago Charter Middle School.
Revenues:The following chart shows the driving factors of the LCFF in addition to ADA:
Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)

5.33%

3 Year Rolling Unduplicated English Learner (EL), Free/ Reduced (F/R) and Foster Youth (FY)
Student Percentage

47.37%

Until the state adopts its 2022-23 Budget, the proposed funded LCFF yields an estimated $896,602 net decrease compared to
the prior year. The reason for the decline in funding is attributed to the sunsetting of the hold harmless provisions. The applied
5.33% COLA does not completely cover the loss in funding from student enrollment decline.
Most state categorical entitlements and grants known to be ongoing are projected at current levels. Only special education
AB602 funding is expected to receive the 5.33% COLA. No increase is anticipated for ongoing federal programs in this adoption.
Interest earnings are projected at .56% and the lottery is estimated at $228 per student ($163 unrestricted, $65 restricted by
Proposition 20).
