Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Public Contract Code Section 10298 allows the State to consolidate the needs of multiple state agencies for
goods, information technology, and services and to establish contracts, master agreements, multiple award schedules,
cooperative agreements, including agreements with entities outside the state, and other types of agreements that leverage the
states buying power. Local agencies may contract with suppliers awarded those contracts without further competitive bidding
upon the same terms and conditions agreed to by the State.
On March 14, 2023, the State of California awarded California Multiple Award Schedule (CMAS) Contract Number4-23-03-1040
(Contract) for the purchase of flooring to Mike's Custom Flooring, Inc., which is effective through October 11, 2023. Staff
recommends that the Board of Education authorize the use of this CMAS Contract as the States volume pricing would be better
than the District could obtain on its own for the Districts as-needed flooring and installation services.
It is recommended that the Board of Education approve CMAS Contract No.4-23-03-1040, awarded to Mike's Custom Flooring,
effective until October 11, 2023 and all future contract renewal options.

FISCAL IMPACT:Expenditures will be made as needed from various funds not to exceed available budget appropriations.
