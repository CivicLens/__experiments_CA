Category :

12. CONSENT ITEMS - HUMAN RESOURCES

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give the districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term needs.
This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential authorization for
one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover assignments
when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while searching for an
individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It also allows the
individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.
The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.
FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact on the district.

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the Teacher Assignment/Consent Report as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Individual school districts are responsible to provide their respective county superintendent of schools with
evidence of legal and appropriate assignments for all certificated employees. Legal and appropriate assignments for certificated
employees are those based upon the authorization(s) contained on the specific certificate(s) held by the certificated employee,
as well as additional assignments which are authorized "assignment options" by the Education Code.
Most of the assignment options provided by the Education Code allow a teacher to serve in an additional assignment, provided
that the teacher has received a specified level of training relative to the subject area to be taught, that the teacher consents to
the assignment, and that the local governing board takes action on the assignment. These assignment options are typically
employed in middle schools and high schools where the teacher is assigned to instruct groups of students in a specific subject
matter area or areas.
The teachers/assignments listed on the Teacher Assignment/Consent Report reflect legal and appropriate assignments based
upon authorized assignment options in the Education Code where the teacher has met all requirements and has consented to
the assignment.
