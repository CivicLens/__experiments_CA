DESCRIPTION:Change Order 24R1 is a change order for Canyon High School in the amount of $364,604.27.
This change order is based on substantive items from April 2022 through the end of the project on September 12, 2022 that were
still under negotiation by the Project Construction Management Team at the time Change Order Number 23 was presented to
the Board in August 2022. Change Order 24R1 is based on two categories of claims:

1. Building Construction Related Change Orders: The majority of items are construction related. Over the course of
construction, while the new kitchen project was underway at Canyon High School, seismic-related Department of State
Architect ("DSA") requirements were added to the scope of work that were not requested when plans were originally
approved. These changes can be identified through PCOs ("Potential Change Orders") 216, 236 and 237.
2. Extension of Time to Complete Work: Accounting for extensions granted in previous change orders, the completion date
was set for July 4, 2022. The project was actually completed on September 12, 2022, a time period of 70 days. While
Swinerton, the contractor, sought costs for these delays, the total number of days was negotiated at 47 days and
addressed in the remaining PCO 204.
The total value of the contract, which includes Change Order Numbers 1 through 24, will increase from $41,202,819 to
$41,567,423.The Project is still within the anticipated project budget.

District is one of two remaining districts in Orange County that has not yet done so. The conversion eliminates duplicate entries
into two different systems and time-consuming reconciliation processes. OCDE hosts and supports the system. The system
conversion year was to have been during the 2019-20 year but was interrupted by the pandemic. The District now seeks to
resume that process. The system conversion fees are $221,375, a decrease of $69,131 from the initial proposal.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: At the December 15, 2021, board meeting, the Board approved a contract with Colbi Technologies ("Colbi") to
provide additional support for the facilities department. The need for the support arose from the projects identified in the ESSER
III presentation that were board-approved at the October 21, 2021, board meeting, as well as other district projects not related to
the Measure S program. The Board approved the sum of $150,000 for the 2022 calendar year. As the projects are spread over a
three-year period (2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-24), the district is requesting to continue the contract with Colbi for the 2023 calendar
year. The District has not used all of the funds allocated for the 2022 calendar year. The District is therefore requesting that the
contract be approved such that it does not exceed the original $150,000 allocation and that the unused funds from that allocation
be carried to the 2023 calendar year contract.
