completing the long-range Facilities Master Plan that will be in place for many years to come. Also, the EDGE, the
strategic plan, was one of Mrs. Moffat's initiatives and resulted in outstanding educational programs, effective use of the
facilities, as well as working on Measure S and utilizing our resources to the best of our abilities. Dr. Hansen also thanked
Mrs. Moffat for bringing back the study sessions which increased the transparency to the community.
Mrs. Moffat handed the gavel to Mrs. Yamasaki.
Mrs. Moffat mentioned it was an honor to serve and represent this board in such interesting times. With the board and
leadership working together, Orange Unified managed to keep the schools open in the challenging school year 20202021. She put together a board governance handbook and held much needed meetings with discussions about school
budgets, the Facilities Master Plan and Charter Schools. 2021 saw the completion of key efforts that took years of
collaborative work between Orange Unified staff and community members. One was the adoption of the Facilities Master
Plan and the adoption of the sex education curriculum. She is grateful to all her colleagues for caring about Orange
Unified School District, our students, our staff, and our community. She appreciates all the contributions. She called on
the board to renew their commitment to civility and respect at the meetings. The example of the Board Members set a
tone for the meetings. She thanked everyone again for allowing her to be the president. It was an honor.
Andrea Yamasaki thanked Kathy Moffat for her experience and wisdom that guided the board through 2021. It was an
honor to serve with her and Mrs. Yamasaki is grateful for her service. Mrs. Moffat wanted to improve collaboration and
transparency and Mrs. Yamasaki would like to continue. She's proud to follow her as a president and she is looking
forward to her guidance and mentorship. Mrs. Yamasaki has been an advocate for the students of Orange Unified for 17
years as a volunteer, a parent, and the last five years as a board member. Student education, wellbeing and health are
her priorities. The last two years have been very challenging on many fronts for students, teachers, staff, and parents.
The common goal for all is doing what is best for our students. The vision of Mrs. Yamasaki for 2022 is for our board to
work together even though there are differences in views, we must put the interest of the students first, put politics aside
and work for the students. Mrs. Yamasaki is looking forward to a productive and successful year.

5. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Hansen thanked everyone for their tremendous efforts over the past years. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread
across three school years, impacting three grade levels. She is hopeful there will be change in the 2022 year.
A video was shown on the deferred maintenance project.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
At the last meeting, Mrs. Yamasaki tabled two resolutions to work on one resolution. She hopes the board can find a
workable solution for all parties involved.
Mrs. Yamasaki mentioned she toured the pre-school sites and thanked Cheryl Sosa for sharing about the program and
giving a tour. Mrs. Yamasaki spent four productive days at the CSBA conference in San Diego. These days were filled
with speakers, meetings, award ceremonies, and workshops. Highlights of the conference were the Golden Bell award
ceremony for Jordan Academy, and featured panelist and Canyon High School alumni Jasmine Nguyen who addressed a
crowd of thousands speaking about board policies that are important to students. Dr. Victor Rios, professor and author,
inspired Mrs. Yamasaki with an inspirational and provoking talk. As a former High School drop-out, juvenile delinquent
and former gang member, he turned his life around because of one of his teachers. There is a great opportunity for TK to
grade 12 students: until January 31, students can read unlimited books for free. Please refer to the California Department
of Education website for information.
Mrs. Yamasaki is very grateful to the district for investing in our board members.
Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Board member Kathy Moffat talked about the CSBA annual Education conference. She mentioned there were strict COVID
protocols and rules. Everyone should know that rules are different for every setting. She attended a workshop about
changing laws that affect schools, and another workshop on Charter Schools. It's always great to have discussions with
other districts about the challenges they are facing and get tips about what works well and what doesn't.
The City of Orange Tree Lightning event was beautiful. It was nice to be with neighbors and friends and enjoy the music
and spectacle. Mrs. Moffat is very grateful for Mike Short, teacher at Orange High School, who conducted the orchestra
and choir.
She is also looking forward to the opening of the Villa Park High School Science Center tomorrow.
Board Member Kris Erickson thanked Kathy Moffat for her services as president. She admires the passion Mrs. Moffat has
for students and Orange unified. She has a passion to keep learning and has a lot of wisdom and experience. Mrs. Moffat
has always been committed to good governance and has shown that as president. The highlight of the year was the CSBA
conference. It is an opportunity to bond with other school board members, to learn strategies to be a better board
member, and what to do to be successful. The Legal Symposium was fantastic, and she got a lot out of it. Other
interesting workshops discussed masks and vaccinations, and Ethnic Studies. The Golden Bell Award Ceremony was a
highlight of the conference. Mrs. Erickson is also excited about the opening of the Science Center tomorrow.
Board Member Ana Page attended a family engagement workshop at the CSBA conference and a workshop on student
board members. She is talking with Assistant Superintendent Cathleen Corella about engaging our student board
members, and Mrs. Page is excited to work with our students.
Board Member Angie Rumsey attended the CSBA conference as well. She appreciated the opportunity to meet board
members of other districts and network. She attended a Critical Race Theory, Ethnic studies & Assembly Bill 101
workshop. The presenters confirmed that districts can embed an ethnic studies curriculum into core subjects like English
and History. Mrs. Rumsey also attended a workshop on Charter Schools. The presenters emphasized Charter Schools can
remove barriers and present an opportunity to deal with equity and develop relationships in the community. They said
Charters can increase student attendance and the presenters reminded the participants that board members are to be
advocates for and celebrate students' success, including those in Charter Schools.
Mrs. Rumsey was impacted by the keynote speaker Dr. Rios and his teacher. He talked about not labeling the child but
rather the behavior. Dr. Rios called people in education changemakers and encouraged them to stand up for kids. His
teacher believed in him so much that she tricked him in believing in himself.
Information: D. State of the School Report: Orlando Neri- Richland High School
Superintendent Hansen introduced Orlando Neri and mentioned Richland High School won Model Continuation School for
the third time this year. In his State of the School Report, Student Board Member Orlando Neri shared a video that
showed Richland high School is more than a school: it's a family that soars together.
Board President Yamasaki acknowledged principal Lisa Ogan. At her last visit to the school, Mrs. Yamasaki was touched
by the many students who seem happy to be at the school. It's a small school that felt like a community.

Lisa Ogan thanked the board for all the support. She mentioned how proud she is of the students and introduced the
activity director and the student representatives.
Information: E. Innovation and Excellence Report
Executive Director, Innovation and Excellence Joe Erven presents the item. This month, Jordan Academy received the
CSBA Golden Bell Award for Curriculum and Instruction through the California Standards Implementation for Integrated

Action: B. AUTHORIZATION OF SUBSTITUTE TEACHER RATES
Assistant Superintendent Human Resources Mr. Gonzalez presented the item. Districts are required to keep an adequate
pool of substitute teachers to have sufficient coverage of our classes. School districts nationwide are currently
experiencing a significant shortage of substitute teachers. Many school districts have responded with raising the rates for
substitute teachers, thereby raising the competition for qualified substitute teachers. The current rate of pay was
established in September 2015. Based on current comparable rates in the county and to keep a viable pool of substitute
teachers, it is recommended to raise the rates for certificated substitute teachers who possess a valid California Teaching
Credential based on a bachelor's degree, teacher preparation program and student teaching. The current rate will
continue for the certificated substitute teachers who serve on a 30-day substitute teaching credential and CTE credential
or other similar documents.
Some questions were answered.
It is recommended that the Board of Education approve the proposed adjustment to the substitute teacher rates of pay
effective January 6, 2022.
