DESCRIPTION:Public Contract Code Section 20118 states if there is an existing contract between a public agency and a vendor
for the lease or purchase of data-processing equipment, materials, supplies, equipment, automotive vehicles, tractors, and other
personal property, the governing board of a school district may authorize the lease or purchase of such personal property directly
from the vendor under the same terms as another public agency contract.
Irvine Unified School District (IUSD) awarded a competitively bid multi-year contract, Bid No. 19/20-01, for the purchase of
different types of technology equipment and peripherals,to CDW-Government LLC (CDWG). That contract, which isvalid through

December 31, 2024, included language that allows other school districts to purchase identical equipment at the same
competitive prices.
To improve student and bus driver safety and security on all school buses, staff reviewed the use of digital video recorders
(DVRs) and interior and exterior cameras (Cameras). TheGatekeeper brand of DVRs and Cameras offered superior performance
and features, namely: the interior cameras can record with infrared technology in no-light conditions, are equipped with
microphones to clearly record audio, and can capture views in between high-back seats; the exterior cameras will provide 360degree coverage for blind-spot detection, and front dash and rear views around the school buses; and the recorded information
will automatically download wirelessly when buses pull into the transportation yard reducing the transfer time and helping to
speed up the review process.
Since the Gatekeeper DVRs and Cameras areavailable through the IUSD contract with CDWG, at competitive prices, staff
recommends that the Board of Education approve the purchase of these units accordingly.

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable-term. Short-term waivers give the districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term needs.

This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential authorization for
one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover assignments
when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while searching for an
individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It also allows the
individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.
