[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Hello school board and thank you for giving me the time to speak.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   My name is Marcus Jewel and I am in fifth grade.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   I think the school needs to grow.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   This school should grow because it focuses on virtues, not just in intelligence.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   It also needs to grow so more people may attend.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   If you vote no, that will affect my learning and I may not attend for high school.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   This will not only affect me but all the students in OCCA's middle school and my fellow fifth graders.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Many people will be happy and enjoy the school and learn about virtues.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I think the school is different because I never learned about virtues at my former school.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Please approve the parole to set today.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Thank you for your time and good night.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Good evening board president, members of the board and superintendent.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   My name is Annabelle Yee and I am in seventh grade at Orange County Classical Academy.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   I've only been with this school for about a year and a half,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   yet this school has taught me so much more than other schools have done in this class.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Not only does this school follow a curriculum that makes you work for your education,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   but they teach us about intellectual and moral virtues.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   They teach us to be prudent with our words and to have temperance in class.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   They teach us to demonstrate fortitude and justice in the real world.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   This school has brought something valuable to my life and I believe having a high school will bring the same knowledge to many other kids.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Please vote yes on the parole to set so other kids can have the same experience as me.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Thank you.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Okay, I have Danala and then Sarah and then behind is Emmett,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Edlund, Linda Nell, Shane Bayless and Kathy Trask.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Danala?
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Good evening board members.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   My name is Danala Fix and I've been going to OCCA since we first opened our doors in 2020.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   OCCA would push past our comfort zones to grow as intellectuals,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   or taught not just how to excel in grades but as well as cert shoes.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   As an eighth grader, I would really appreciate the opportunity to be able to be a high schooler at OCCA.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   This would allow me to continue learning the way that works for me as an individual.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   I would be very grateful if you would allow us to lease this vacant space as a parole to property for 25 years.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   A shorter lease would not provide enough funding for my school to have a high school for my peers in high school.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   I implore you to vote in favor of OCCA for a no result in another group of eighth graders including me having to leave.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Starting high school is a very big change in every middle schooler's life and I would love to start high school at OCCA.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   I'd like to end with a quote.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Intelligence plus character that is the goal of true education.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Thank you for your time and have a wonderful evening.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   [Applause]
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Good evening board members.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   My name is Sarah Holig and I stand before you today requesting to consider leasing the parole to campus to OCCA.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   OCCA is an amazing school and will be life changing for me and my classmates.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Not only for me but for the generations to come.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Leasing the parole site to OCCA will expand my educational experience and not just for me but for everybody.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   For all my classmates and all the students in Orange City.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   By OUSD sharing resources we can improve the education experience for all students and create and help our community.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Thank you for listening.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   [Applause]
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Next up is Emmett Edlund and I named a couple of others.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Let me just make sure Quinn Darnell, Shane Bayless, Kathy Trask, Scarlett Darnell, Evie Dam, Grace Gault, Richard T.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   I think this might be an adult.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And then Kira Sato.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   So Emmett, Emmett is up and then Quinn and then Shane.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Hi, I am Emmett.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Hi, my name is Emmett and I am a fifth grader at OCCA.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   This is my fourth year there.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   OCCA has been an amazing school.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   I never been to a school better than OCCA.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   It helps me a lot and I improve in my work with all that they do for me.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   They make all of the learning very interesting.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   The teachers help us a lot so that we can do our best.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   I hope you approve the plan so that I can go to OCCA through high school.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Please vote yes today to give OCCA high school.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Thank you.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Okay, Quinn Darnell.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Good evening board members and thank you for your time.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   My name is Quinn Darnell and I am in first grade.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   This is my second year at OCCA.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   I love going to school with my big brother and sister.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   My hope is that we could all graduate at OCCA and I hope we can use
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   the word "Protasite" to open our high school.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Our pillars teach us virtues that will help us in the future.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Thank you.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Shane?
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Hello board members and thank you for inviting me.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   My name is Shane Bayliss and I am in seventh grade.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   My home at OCCA is a place where I can learn prudently.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   We learn Latin as one of our classes where it is the starting ground
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   to many Latin-based languages such as Spanish, French, Romanian, Italian and Portuguese.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   We also learn deeply about history and not social studies.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Learning true history is important in many ways.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   We learn about the men who died for our freedom.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   We learn about our rights in the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Without learning the history of the world, how am I supposed to know my rights
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   and how to advocate for others?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   So please, let me expand my education at OCCA.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   This way I can be a contributing member of society in the future.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Thank you.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Good evening OASD board members.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   My name is Kathy Trask.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   I am sixth grader at OCCA.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   We as a sixth grade have been told that our math and science teacher is moving
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   to the position of team of students.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Mr. Chappu will not be teaching.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   If we don't have a high school, all of us will have to say goodbye
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   to a student to be a great team of students early.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   We all love Mr. Chappu so much and if he's saying no to the Peralta site,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   we will have to leave him and he won't be able to go every day to our class and say hi.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   We adore Mr. Chappu.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Please vote yes to the Peralta share plan.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Thank you for keeping Mr. Chappu good night.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Good evening board.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   I am Scotland and I will current sixth grader at OCCA.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   I have been at OCCA since the beginning and hope to continue through high school.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   We have shown great fortitude by fighting through impossible odds.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Please vote yes and let us use the Peralta site.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   We hope to use this site for a long term.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   I am sure all the eighth graders have made friends at OCCA and couldn't bear to leave them.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Peralta has been vacant for many years and we would like to put it to some use.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Finally, I am thinking the board for considering our proposal.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Vote yes. Thank you and good night.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Okay, I have Evie, then Grace, then Richard, then Kira, and then Juliana.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Good evening, OUSD board members.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   My name is Evie Dam, current seventh grader at Orange County Classical Academy.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   OCCA is a public school, but unlike others, it teaches us to be good, beautiful, and true.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   OCCA gives us a free and true education.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   We need the school to teach us these treats.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   These are important to ourselves and others.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   These help us be good human beings.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Our teachers push us to think and work hard because if we don't, we fail.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   In my history class, we analyzed the Constitution and understood it, line for line.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   A lot of people have read it, but not many have understood it.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   We understood it because our teachers took the time to help us.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Some people use our curriculum, but we use it for sure.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Please think on what I say because we need a high school for Orange County Classical Academy.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Thank you.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Hello, my name is Grace Gull and I am a student at OCCA.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   I am currently a sixth grader, and when I graduate, I want to play soccer at UCLA.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Before going to OCCA, I did not think it was possible to even go to college because I have an IP for reading.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   At public school, I could not learn how to read because they teach site-based learning,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   and at OCCA, they teach phonics-based reading, and that's what works for me.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Please say yes to our high school, so students like me with learning differences can continue to achieve our big dreams.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Thank you.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Okay, I have Richard, and then Kira, and then Juliana.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Good evening, board.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   My name is Richard, and I'm in fifth grade.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   I have attended OCCA since the school first opened along with my older brother and younger sister.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   At OCCA, I have made many friends and enjoy the classical education I'm getting there.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   My friends and I are thriving at OCCA.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   We love our school and are here once again to ask you to approve the lease of Peralta property.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   It would mean so much to be able to continue through high school.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Please don't let us down and vote yes for students like me to continue our education.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Having a great school like OCCA and the community benefits everyone.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Thank you for your time and consideration.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Thank you.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Hello, my name is Kira Sato, and I'm a sixth grader at OCCA.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Having a high school at OCCA would mean a lot to me.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   It would mean that me and my peers could have to continue a great education of academics and virtue all the way through high school.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   I have been at OCCA since fourth grade, and since then, I have been taught to strive for excellence in what is good, beautiful, and true.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   I love my school and don't want to leave my classical education where the many friends I've met at OCCA any time soon.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   I really hope you approve my school's lease of Peralta for 25 years.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   By doing this, I know you'll make everyone at OCCA very happy.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Thank you, and have a good night.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Okay, after Juliana, we have Tina Arias-Miller, Howard Kim, Ariana Castillas, Abby Sedgwick, Luke Joseph Macias,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Haleana Dawson, Juliana.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Hello, board members. My name is Juliana Colmack, and I'm in seventh grade.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   I want more than anything to graduate from OCCA as a high schooler.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   OCCA's curriculum is meant to be from TK to the end of high school, not to be transferred to other schools, with different styles of education.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Therefore, I implore you to make the right decision that will benefit so many in the OCCA lease of Peralta.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Thank you for your time.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Okay, so I have Tina and then Howard.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Are you Tina?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Oh, okay. We're doing students first. Sorry, I had indicated students here.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   So we'll put you behind the students. Thank you.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Ms. Mayer, do you -- I'm assuming there's probably 32 students that are going to speak, which means that they will run the clock.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   There's 29.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Okay, so I think that we need to -- I mean, these are big issues.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   They are adult issues. The children have done a phenomenal job, and I'm -- you are all amazing, for sure.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   But it's been three meetings in a row now that we -- we haven't had any adult input, and I think it's really important that we at least extend the time for somebody who's come over from San Diego Canyon College to speak.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   I think that's important. So I asked at least that we extend the time to have a couple of adults have input.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   As I can understand that, and can appreciate it, but we're going to stick to our 30-minute rule, and so we will adhere to that, and if there's 29, then she'll have an opportunity to speak.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   So that would be 30.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Okay, so Howard can -- sorry, according to our board policy, though, we never indicated that children or students have preference.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Only OUSD students have an opportunity to speak first, and so -- and she's in line with the way the order -- the orders are recorded, so I think she has an opportunity to speak.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   She'll have an opportunity to speak.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Yeah, she'll be number 30 while she skips some other adults in the room as well.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Okay, but we're adhering to our policy of 30 minutes.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Well, then you skip some of the other people who have cards.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   So are you saying that all 29 students came in before any adults?
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   I'm just asking, because at the last meeting it was clear that Trustee Miner knew all the students who were coming in, and that she was coming through the cards.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   They're handed to me with a student check mark in order by the gentleman out.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   There's time for that, right?
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Yes.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   So I think the point is that the policy gives preference towards unified students.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   So then the rest of the 20, 30 minutes or whatever it is, it should be in order.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   And especially in an open session item, we're not -- we're at 6 o'clock at night, so --
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Well, we're still talking, and we're wasting more time.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   So maybe we talk about this later, like we can --
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Well, I think we need to really get cognizant of the viewpoint discrimination, because as one youngster said, you know, we -- they've been invited here to speak, which is fantastic.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   But again, this is a closed session item, and it's also in open session.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   So they'll also have an opportunity in open session to speak to this item as well.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Well, then I would ask --
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   So now your meeting's going to change from closed session to open session.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   And I would ask that we don't repeat the same issue in open session, and then we need to have some variety of voices in open session.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   I don't think we ought to start trying to mix and mingle with our policies here.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   I think we ought to stick to what we're -- stick to what we're all going on.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   If you want -- if you want to -- if you want to -- excuse me, excuse me, I'm speaking now.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   And we are trying to adhere to our policy.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   So I think -- I think if you want to bring this back, and we can revisit it, let's do that.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   But this is not the time.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   No, this is our policy.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   This is what we always do.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   We start -- hey, the twisting and turning is to -- just to assist the board with our conversation.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Because, you know, it was upwards like this.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   I mean, we should remove some of these folks.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   We will.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Again, it's 30 minutes.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   They have an opportunity to open session.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   It's not like it's not going to be presented open session.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   So let's stop wasting time, and let's just get to the cards so we can get to closed session and discuss this.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   >> I'm going to have a superintendent to speak.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   He said that he has something to say.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   >> I just want to make sure that the board is aware so that way that helps them with their conversation.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   >> The board is aware of this.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   The board has a request to speak.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Now, on the card, it says students.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   So I think some people have checked Mark's student, and that's how they've been sorted and handed to the clerk.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   So I think the board is aware of this.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   >> Okay.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   >> I think the board would have to go through all the cards and see what OUSD students.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   My understanding is that there are no OUSD students.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   >> So then all the cards should be read in the order of the time stamps?
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   >> Which they are.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   >> Okay.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   I'll go ahead and draw the cards at the -- at the next meeting.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   I'll be on tomorrow, please.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   The board is aware of the time stamps.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   >> Good evening, board members.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   I thank you for the opportunity to speak today.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   I'm a student that attends OCCA in the seventh grade.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   This decision you will make tonight is decisive in whether or not I will be able to go to high school at my beloved school, OCCA.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   This school is light years ahead of my experience with other previous schools.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   At our school, we just don't focus on intellectual virtue, but moral virtue.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Personally, I've never thought about moral virtues and how to show them.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   I just thought you had to be nice to others.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   I realize that the topic of virtue goes deeper than one can expect, and our school dives right into it.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Though we study moral virtue, we also build our intellectual virtues through a challenging, rich, and failing curriculum.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   So if you decide to vote yes tonight, it will be a great decision providing for this community a new prosperous set.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Thank you for your time, and God bless you.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Ariana and then Abingene.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Hi. My name is Ariana Macias, and I'm a sixth grader at OCCA.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   I am privileged with the position of being commissioner of community and culture for upper school.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   A high school for parolta would be so amazing. OCCA is my second home.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   The expansion to parolta would ensure many free educations.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   OCCA's high school would mean that I can continue my amazing education at my school.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   OCCA is a wonderful school that teaches us to be better human beings.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   The virtues they teach help us grow in our hard-to-say minds.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   No high school would mean no classical education, no place for the eighth graders, and no discussions on how we treat others.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Please say yes. Thank you for your time, and good night.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Abby and then Luke Joseph.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   [ Pause ]
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Good evening, OUSD board. I am honored to be speaking on behalf of my school.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   OCCA is an amazing school, and I would like to go here throughout high school.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   If you let us lease this school, which it would mean that the eighth graders would be able to graduate from high school here.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   OCCA has helped me with my IEP, and I would like to have to go to a new school and get new help.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   I would like to continue going to OCCA, even if it means going through another board meeting, which I hope we don't have to.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   I do struggle in some subjects, but I was taught to push through the hard one and learn from it.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   That is what the school is all about.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   So please say yes to letting us lease this school for 25 years. Thank you for your time, good night.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Luke Joseph, and then Halleana Dawson.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   [ Pause ]
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Hello, my name is Luke Macias, and I live in Orange.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   I think you should help every student in the district.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   You are not helping our school.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   To help us, you can lease the plurals to site 2 OCCA.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Our students would be glad to have an upper school.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   I would be glad too if you vote yes. Thank you.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   After Halleana is Annabelle Felix, Erin Lee, Asher Pickett, Carrie Edlund, and Tina Arias Miller.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Good evening. I'm Halleana, a current sixth grader at OCCA.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   I want you to let our school expand to a high school because this school is like my second home.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   OCCA is the only school that I feel like I fit in and that I'm safe.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   We are a school of kids with many different backgrounds.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   We want a place that teaches moral virtues and an education that allows kids to fully understand the world and how it works.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Before I went to OCCA, I could barely read and do math.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Now there are some of my best subjects.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   We teach what is good, beautiful, and true.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   This is OCCA.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   If you say no to a high school, you are saying no to a safe and good education for these students.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   I want you to take the time to look at everybody who has come here to support us
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   and nobody would come here to support us if we weren't something special.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   Thank you and good night.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   Good evening, OUSD board.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   My name is Ambel Felix and I'm a sixth grader at OCCA.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Please vote yes to letting us have Peralta because if we don't have the space for a high school,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   all the eighth graders, including my sister, would be forced to leave.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Having a high school would mean so much for me, my family, and everyone at OCCA.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   If my sister would have to leave, we would be in different schools for different times
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   resulting in endless driving and late nights for my parents and other parents as well.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Please let us leave Peralta for 25 years.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Thank you and good night.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Thank you board for letting me speak tonight.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   My name is Erin Lee and I'm a sixth grader at OCCA.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   I have been at the school ever since the start and I would really love to see a girl
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   and have a high school so that I can stay longer at the school that I love.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   OCCA teaches us how to be virtuous and gives us a classical education.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   I also have a lot of friends that I would like to stay longer with.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Please let us have a high school so that I can graduate from OCCA high and have great memories.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Thank you.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Okay, last for students is Asher Pickett and then Carrie Edlund and then Tina Miller.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   My name is Asher Pickett and I am in fourth grade at OCCA.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   I want this high school because I love my school.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   I love it so much and I get to see my friends almost every day.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   But if we don't get this high school, I won't get to see my friends anymore when I get to high school.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   So please vote yes to let OCCA, Lee's, Peralta.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Thank you for your time.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Hello, board.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to speak.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   I am an OUSD resident and my fifth grade son spoke a little bit earlier
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   and spoke about how important OCCA and attending OCCA for high school is to him.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   He has had more medical and learning challenges than most of us will experience in a lifetime,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   but he is absolutely thriving at OCCA.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   There is no other high school that he could attend that is like OCCA.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   I am pleading with you to approve the Peralta lease plan tonight so that he can attend OCCA through high school.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Please do it for him and the many other children where classical education is the only learning that works for them.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   In addition to helping the OCCA kids, the approval of the lease will bring in much needed funds
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   to help the kids in OUSD needing special programs.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   This decision to approve the 25-year lease will help all kids in the community,
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   which is what everyone wants.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Please do the right thing.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   Thank you.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Tina Miller.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   Good evening, Mr. President, esteemed board members, Superintendent Gonzalez.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   My name is Tina Arias Miller, trustee for RSCCD Rancho Santiago Community College District College Board.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   I'm here speaking on behalf of the Board of Trustees and the district.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   I'd like to share with you that the district and Santiago Canyon College are very interested
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   in the purchase or long-term lease of the Peralta property as a public entity
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   for the purpose of partnering with OUSD to build a middle college high school.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   We have had successful experience with an existing middle college high school with Santa Ana Unified School District.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   It would be our desire to invest with OUSD, its families, and its students
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   to provide a college pathway experience in our public schools.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   If SCC and OUSD were to partner together to co-locate a middle college high school program
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   and a property that OUSD currently holds, this would be a game changer for increasing enrollment
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   while meeting the workforce needs of our health facilities in the City of Orange.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   Thank you very much for your time.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   That was the 30th.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   Okay, thank you.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   During the closed session.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Okay.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   There are one, two, that's the same person.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   That was for different items.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   They were all handed to me in one pile, excuse me.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Oh, this is about 2D.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   Okay, so we have one, two, three, four, five speakers on 2D.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   Okay, it's JoLynn, Scott, Michelle Weisenberg, Tina again, and Alex Brouson.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Hi.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   This is about the property, leads to the Peralta property.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   It is good to see there is other interest in the property, and we're talking about this
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   is Orange Lutherans specifically in this case.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   Apparently, we have a high priority property that the community college has interested,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   which would help our students.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   Just to be clear, OCCAM sure is an amazing school.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   It is not an OUSD school, so I know those very sweet kids came up and said our school,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   it is their school, and we hope them the best, or at least I personally hope the best for them.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   But I want to make sure we're looking out for OUSD also, and that we're not just taking
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   the first bite when there's these other offers like Orange Lutheran.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   And it does seem a little concerning that this is on the closed session, whether or not,
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   you knew it was on the closed session, you know, you're ready to go back and do it
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   without even acknowledging it, and it's not on the action item.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   This release is on the action item, which somebody is standing here.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   It seems like the little pre-determined, but I don't know.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   I just want to make sure that we're looking out for our students and our school,
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   which is amazing district, and that we're using this property for the best use,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   whether that is a lease to Orange Lutheran or OCCA, or doing a high school like it was just brought up
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   that would benefit everyone.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   And I want to make sure we're not just meeting the needs of some very nice people
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   who are able to come here today and express themselves,
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   but instead that we're looking at meeting the needs that are best for our district.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   Thank you.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   [applause]
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   I have Scott and then Michelle.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Good evening, board.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   Scott Resnick.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   I have a lot of questions about the process for reviewing competing bids.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   I just learned there's a third competing bid that it also benefits OUSD students and residents.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Is it normal to have discussions in closed session with real property negotiations about a parcel
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   that in about an hour you plan to walk into a lease with one of those entities while others are waiting for discussion?
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   Mr. Ortega, you've expressed interest on multiple occasions to pull as much value out of a district's property as possible.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   If you have two entities, now three interested in the same parcel, why was there not a bidding war?
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   Again, Mr. Ortega, Olu claims that they've been in discussions with the district since last year,
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   meeting on six occasions.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   Have you asked around why two weeks ago was the first time you learned about it?
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   Mr. Ortega, as the person who sets the agenda, once you learned of Olu's competing offer,
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   why did you still rush through a special meeting and agendize the finalization agreement with another entity?
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   And last question, Mr. Ortega, is it normal to enter into a discounted arrangement with an entity that owes you $1.7 million
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   and then allow them to use the lease land as collateral to cover that debt?
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   I'm certainly not the only one here with all these questions, but it seems like you plan on closing the book on Peralta
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   for at least a decade and have an answer to a single question from stakeholders in the district.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Thank you.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   Hi, I'm Michelle Weisenberg, I'm a homeowner in the taxpayer,
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   and my concern is regarding the Peralta property that's being discussed tonight.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   So I'm wondering why is it that we are prioritizing OCCA,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   and we even have an action item on it when there is another school that has been also in talks for this,
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   but there is no action item, and in fact, we haven't even heard about a proposal until today with Olu.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Why has it that they've been in talks with the district, yet no one has even brought it out for Olu,
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   for Olu students to come in and talk, for Olu parents to come in and talk.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   Why is it not being discussed at all? Why is OCCA being prioritized?
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Especially now that it's come to light that OCCA owes OUSD $1.7 million in an overpayment that went to them,
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   and instead of paying it back, they spent it, and now they have to pay it back to us.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   They'd entered into an MOU with the district last year for it, and yet we never heard about that,
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   and now we're going to enter into a sweetheart deal for a property when there are two other, it looks like two,
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   at least Olu, competing bids on this, or competing interests in this property.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   It seems to me that we should take a step back and take a good look at all the offers that are out there,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   and not just the one from the entity where Mrs. Miner sends her kids,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   who funded Mrs. Miner's campaign, who funded John Rotega's campaign,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   who funded Angie Ramsey's campaign, who funded Rick Wadesma's campaign,
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   who funded Noam the Recall campaign, and now we have SCC. So, thank you.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   [applause]
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   It is Tina's turn. Thank you.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   Okay, so it is Alex Broussa.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   President Rotega, members of the board, including Ms. Miner and Mr. Ladesma, they're about to get recalled.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   I have a simple question. Why is this agendized under government code 54956.8,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   which has to do with negotiations regarding leases, when there has been no resolution by this board,
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   by two-thirds majority is required by headcode, to accept bids for a lease?
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   There has been no competitive bidding process for a lease.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   In fact, what we have, and what you guys are calling it, is a license with OCCA on the agenda for later tonight.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   So, why are we empowering negotiators to negotiate on a lease,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   when there has been no resolution passed, that we're interested in even leasing the Peralta site?
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   Obviously, we have competing bids, we have interest from Orange Lutheran,
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   we have interest from one other entity that showed up and spoke today,
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   but it's my understanding that there are dozens of other entities that would have interest in the Peralta site.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   So, why aren't we doing this right? Why aren't we doing this pursuant to education code,
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   taking a vote of the board, trying to pass a resolution that we're going to lease this property by two-thirds?
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   It's because you don't have two-thirds.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   And as we have already heard, Madison Minor sends her kids to OCCA.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   You guys need to shove this down our throats, before we recall Madison Minor and Rick Ladesma.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   Now, I heard this board call the document that they're going to enter into a license,
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   but everybody else is calling it a lease.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   OCCA, at their board meeting, agendized it as a lease.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   A dozen OCCA kids got up here and spoke extremely eloquently and extremely passionately,
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   and they're wonderful kids, I'm sure, but they all called it a lease too.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   There's case law out there that says if it cracks like a duck, it waddles, it's got feathers, lives in a pond, it's a duck.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   You guys are trying to pass a lease and pass it off as a license, and ignore competitive bids,
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   ignore the education code, and it's not going to stand. You all are going to get sued for it. Thank you. Bye.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   (applause)
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   Okay, during the closed session at 6.20.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   I'd like to make a comment before we adjourn. I'd like to make a comment, please.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   All right. No, I'd like to make a comment, because it pertains to closed session.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   No, I'd like to make a comment. No, I'd like to make a comment right now.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   I'd like to thank, first of all, all the speakers for coming, especially the children.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   I commend you for coming here, because I know it's hard, and you're advocating for your school.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   At our last meeting, trustee Miner's own son appeared before this board and asked us to approve.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   Okay, this is not called for, so please stop.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   If this piece of contract is approved, no, trustee Miner's son and their families will be benefiting.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.

[02:04:38.000 --> 02:05:07.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:34.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:06:03.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:32.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:07:01.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:27.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:56.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:23.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:50.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:09:19.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:48.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:10:16.000]   I'd like to make a motion to adjourn, so I can go.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:21.000]   I also wanted to point out that Villa Park High School was one of nine campuses
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:28.000]   honored by the College Board with the 2023 AP Computer Science Female Diversity Award
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:35.000]   for their work towards equal gender representation by engaging more female students in computer science.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:43.000]   Since 2016, the College Board has honored schools that reach 50% or higher female examinee representation
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.000]   in one or both AP computer science courses.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:56.000]   So I'd like to commend Villa Park High School for receiving that prestigious award.
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:06.000]   Lastly, I'd like to say that last night at Almedina High School, they hosted many families and students
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:12.000]   for their showcase and community open house, and are you going to talk about that more?
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:17.000]   Okay, so I will stop there, but it was a great event, and I do want to point out that Canyon High Schools
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.000]   is coming on February 21st, and are you going to talk about that?
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:27.000]   I will stop there. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:34.000]   Thank you, Mr. Gonzalez. On to Item 4B, Board President's Report.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:41.000]   I would like to just mention that I appreciate that will be addressed at the end. Thank you.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:48.000]   Wait, hold on, hold on. Blue cards on the President's address are at the end? Why?
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.000]   Yes.
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000]   Why?
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000]   I said at the end, this is the Board President's Report.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000]   Right, but if they're talking about the Board President's, what you've made in your reports,
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:59.000]   then that's fair to agendize.
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000]   It is not.
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000]   It is.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:07.000]   That's not part of the agendize. It's not an action item. It's not an information item.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:14.000]   It's not something that's...it's just not.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:18.000]   How many speakers are there? Is it going to take a whole bunch of time?
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:21.000]   That's pointless. So, on to that is going to be...
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:27.000]   Hold on a second. You can't just change the rules. We've always done this.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.000]   We've always had speakers before an agenda item. And why are you not doing this?
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:33.000]   It's not an agenda item. It's not an agenda item.
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:38.000]   We need to define agenda items. Agenda items are action and information and consent.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:42.000]   That's the business of the Board. That is correct.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000]   And so, that board meeting will be taken at the end.
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.000]   Do you have people to speak on the adoption of agenda in the past?
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.000]   Again, we probably did it wrong.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.000]   That's good. We've done a lot of things before.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000]   And so, right now, that's going at the end.
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:03.000]   Well, I just want to say on the record that I think this is not a...
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000]   Again, I've placed enough. Okay?
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000]   This is not...
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000]   This is the Board President's report.
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:14.000]   You can speak next when it comes to board recognition of public and staff. Okay?
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:19.000]   So, stop interrupting.
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:27.000]   So, what I wanted to say was, is that I appreciate you understanding that we did have to make a change
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000]   in our location due to the inclement weather.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:37.000]   We've all been through this, you know, for the last several days with it in that manner.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:45.000]   So, I truly appreciate you. I truly appreciate the staff for providing Villa Park for the potential of the meeting.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:52.000]   And also, with our maintenance operation, and they're going to have a tremendous amount of work ahead of them with the rainstorms that have occurred.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.000]   So, I just want to thank all of our staff in preparation for it.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000]   They did a wonderful preparation.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:08.000]   So, I truly appreciate that and appreciate them for their due diligence of checking all the boxes to make sure that everything was going to be addressed.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:15.000]   And also, as been mentioned about our showcases and things that are occurring,
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:20.000]   there's a lot of positive things happening in our school district right now, so that's a great thing.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:25.000]   And so, we just want to continue moving forward in a very positive manner.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:32.000]   I know some things have been brought to light and I just wanted to share and ask.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:38.000]   I know I didn't ask them before ahead of time, but some of the things that we've been doing,
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:48.000]   because the public's been asking about it, about Orange Unified School District is not in this campaign at all.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:53.000]   Our schools are not in this campaign at all.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:15:05.000]   I know there's been some information, there's been some misrepresentation of our schools in this campaign and that is a misrepresentation in such a way.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:20.000]   And I believe Mr. Gonzalez has sent a letter out to the campaigns and also to the principals to let them know that they can address their communities appropriately.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:28.000]   That that school is not involved in the campaign nor is Orange Unified School District involved in the campaign.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:34.000]   So, I just want to make that crystal clear or as about as clear as the day is long.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:40.000]   So, hopefully that can alleviate some questions, concerns.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:53.000]   Like I said, this letter just went out late last week, so everyone should have received it by now being notified in reference to the Education Code and the laws related to it.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:04.000]   So, hopefully this puts an end to a lot of stuff so that we can continue to move forward that we're not Orange Unified involved with this nor our schools.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:18.000]   And again, we're broken record, but I want to make it crystal clear our schools are being misrepresented right now and that is completely incorrect in how they're going about doing that.
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.000]   So, anyway, let's move forward.
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:29.000]   We have a big meeting ahead of us and on to board recognition of student staff and community.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:34.000]   I think it is somebody.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.000]   I got to visit Villa Park High School last week and it was an awesome visit.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:45.000]   I got to see a bunch of the teachers in action and I got to look over the campus.
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000]   There wasn't any water damage yet.
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:17:03.000]   He took it out of his own budget, which I thought was really nice of him.
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:10.000]   And I also got to visit the ASV room and see Mr. Tran and the rest of the leadership on campus.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:16.000]   They did a fantastic job meeting their meeting and how they conducted it was really awesome to see them.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000]   And I look forward tomorrow.
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.000]   I'll be back at Villa Park High School again for a French wedding, which I will understand that up.
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.000]   But I'm excited to be there because I got to go last year.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000]   My daughter was in the wedding last year.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000]   It was a hot mess because she just ran everywhere.
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.000]   But hopefully this year she'll walk down the aisle straight.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000]   So I look forward to that tomorrow.
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.000]   Thank you.
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.000]   Anyone else?
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000]   Mr. Erickson.
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000]   Sure.
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.000]   And this is on behalf of the community.
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:18:00.000]   For the second time, Mr. Ortega has been slapped with a letter from the First Amendment Coalition for his threats to the campaigns at the last meeting.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:11.000]   And I think that when you're giving a report and you're throwing in your opinion and that opinion is not just reporting on something.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000]   It's appropriate to allow public comment on that.
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:17.000]   And I think that that violates the rules.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:21.000]   I think it's appropriate for people to be able to address that.
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:31.000]   And as I said, for the second time in a row, you've received a letter from the First Amendment Coalition saying that you violated the First Amendment rights of individuals.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:38.000]   Again, we're stacking speakers so that adults don't have an opportunity to speak and it is viewpoint discrimination.
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000]   How is this part of the community?
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.000]   Because I'm addressing you because there's no other opportunity.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000]   This isn't about the community.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.000]   This isn't about the community.
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000]   So is there something about the community?
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000]   Because the community wants to be heard.
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.000]   The community wants to be heard.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:59.000]   Excuse me, one more outburst and you're out.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:00.000]   It's all right.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:03.000]   That is my comment on behalf of the community.
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000]   And I think that it's wrong.
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:10.000]   I think it's absolutely wrong that you are studying to go including your fellow board members.
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000]   But that's it.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:15.000]   I wanted to, it's been busy.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:21.000]   I did go by the Villa Park High School Showcase and it was a really wonderful time.
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000]   All of the feeder schools did an amazing job.
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:31.000]   There was a lot of talent there, both by the Villa Park students and by all of the feeder schools as well.
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000]   And it was just a lot of fun.
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000]   I was able to go by Elmo for two seconds last night.
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:40.000]   But very good job over there as well.
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:47.000]   And last week I was able to go to the Gallon Times celebration with Chapman Hills moms.
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000]   And that was really fun for me.
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000]   It was kind of a return home.
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:51.000]   That's where I started.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:55.000]   My kids went to starting kindergarten at Chapman Hills.
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:00.000]   I made some of my very great friends there in the kindergarten pickup line.
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:06.000]   And it was just really nice to see that community and to see these moms all coming together.
[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:15.000]   Just like we did when I was there to raise money and to really do a lot to help the students at Chapman Hills.
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:18.000]   So I appreciate being invited to the event.
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:25.000]   I will also be at the French wedding tomorrow and also on Monday I'll be going to the STEM teacher of the year award.
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:28.000]   And congratulations to your bureau for that award.
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000]   Great job.
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:36.000]   Anyone else?
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000]   Thank you.
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:46.000]   First of all, I'd like to thank staff for jumping through hoops to try to make the meeting happen over at fellow staff for my understanding.
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:53.000]   It was a lot of work, a lot of time and effort to try to make that work.
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:59.000]   It was highly unusual for the board president to make the unilateral decision without presenting the entire board.
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:05.000]   I did not get an adequate explanation as to why it was necessary to more meeting over there.
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:10.000]   That being said, I would like to recommend that in the future if we have any other meetings,
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:17.000]   that's not going to be in this program that we discussed as a board so that we have to give adequate notice.
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:29.000]   I just felt like that when we get back here could potentially be a violation of the Brown Act because we did not notice the public adequately.
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:41.000]   So in the future, please let us know if you want to move the board meeting to another venue and state the reason why.
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:51.000]   I would also like to, first of all, I attended the OECPTA Reflections Ceremony this week.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000]   It took place here in the boardroom.
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:22:04.000]   Art pieces including visual arts, photography, dance choreography, literature, and music compositions were created by OECP students and were on display.
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:12.000]   I think a huge thank you to our PTA volunteers, our PTA reflection coordinators at each of the schools.
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:15.000]   It's a complicated process.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:25.000]   They do it at the school level and then the winners from the school level goes up to the council level and then the council level goes up to the district level and the district goes to the state and then national.
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:31.000]   So there's lots of layers and we've had students go up to the state level before and it's very exciting.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:41.000]   We may have thousands and thousands of children who participate in this program and grateful for the volunteers that made it happen for our students.
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:48.000]   I also attended the gallantines over at Chattanooga Hills and also the Vella Park Showcase.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:52.000]   It was a lot of fun since Trustee Erickson talked about it.
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000]   I will just leave it there.
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:03.000]   And I also wanted to mention that yesterday I had an opportunity to speak to Chris Goucher from No Canyon Elementary School.
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:17.000]   They wanted to hear from someone in leadership and they wanted to talk about the stereotypes and challenges and they asked so many great questions and it was great to be in front of kids.
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:27.000]   The last thing is this Saturday is the Lunar New Year and I'm looking forward to checking out all the Lunar New Year celebrations at our schools.
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:41.000]   We have one coming up next week at Canyon Free School put on by the Mandarin Pacific Immersion Program and so that's always a lot of fun.
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:49.000]   As well, if anybody wants to attend, it's on February 15th.
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:55.000]   So, I just want to wish everyone a happy holiday to all of those who celebrate.
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:01.000]   Thank you, Ms. Page.
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:13.000]   Thank you. The Lunar New Year celebration will be at 6.30 at Canyon High and all the MIP students from Kinder all the way up are preparing for that celebration.
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:25.000]   So, in addition to singing songs in Mandarin, they're going to study calligraphy and that's what's going to be hanging along the walls inside the Canyon High School Pack is the Performing Arts Center.
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:35.000]   And then also a couple weeks ago, I attended the Orange Showcase, which was completely filled with performances in the dome.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:43.000]   And then every feeder elementary school was able to show off all of the fantastic programs that they have to offer.
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:54.000]   So, students in the elementary school can visit the high school and also visit the farm that they have and I'll let Nancy share a little bit more of the highlights that are going on there.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:10.000]   But I also wanted to give props to everyone who's worked so hard to promote a lot of these showcases, not just students preparing for performances, but to their teachers, their administrators, and even a lot of the staff.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:23.000]   That takes a lot of hours and effort to really promote because these showcases are not just for our students, but for our community to come in and be able to see all the fantastic work that's happening in Orange Unified.
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.000]   Thank you.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.000]   Thank you.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000]   Anyone else?
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.000]   Okay.
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:28.000]   Thank you.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:29.000]   Oh, sorry.
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:38.000]   I just want to do a quick PSA very quickly in regards to board recognition of staff, students, and community.
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000]   I know last week we had our amazing smart con.
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000]   Thank you for everybody that came.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:49.000]   But several parents raised concerns to me about people wearing recall shirts, teachers, and hooded.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:54.000]   I believe that there's a time and place for politics, our school sites should not be in.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:57.000]   And unfortunately, I was giving tours, right?
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:02.000]   And this is an opportunity where I get to highlight some of our amazing facilities and academic programs.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:10.000]   When somebody's wearing a recall shirt, whether it be political or not, including a recall shirt, I just wanted to mention that these places are not for politics.
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:14.000]   Unfortunately, there's a lot of politics in our community right now, especially when it's very polarizing.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:20.000]   And our schools, especially our high schools, should not be places where you bring in your polarization.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000]   Whether it be yes recall or no recall.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:26.000]   So please, please keep your politics out, that's all I ask.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:27.000]   Thank you.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:33.000]   And I should mention, I should mention, I did speak to Superintendent Gonzalez.
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:37.000]   While it is legally permissible, it is severely inappropriate.
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000]   Several parents raised concerns to me.
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:42.000]   Thank you so much.
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:45.000]   Thank you.
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]   So.
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:55.000]   All right.
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:09.000]   We were the first schools that have the showcase in the district and we had over 2000 people on our campus, including our feeder schools, parents and community members.
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:16.000]   It was a great opportunity to show off everything all the students in our schools are working hard for.
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:27.000]   We have schools, our feeder schools, band dances and spirit, and we also had an opportunity to show all of our CTE classes on campus.
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:33.000]   For those that don't know, my school Orange High School is an avid demonstration school.
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:42.000]   And just last week, we were revalidated being the only school in the district that is a demo school and one of the very few schools in the country.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:49.000]   It's a demonstration school.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:58.000]   Yesterday, we had a STEM day at Yorba Middle School, and we were welcomed by many of the staff and students.
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:07.000]   We brought our choir, our CTE courses, cheer and band, and we got to interact with all the Yorba students inside their classrooms and during lunch.
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:17.000]   We had all our CTE pathways involving one class or another, and we had their multi-purpose room to showcase all our programs at Orange High School.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:24.000]   And many of them were excited to see their Orange High School stickers and our spider lab and a lot of other things.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:29.000]   Today on campus, we had a Vapa Day, which is our visible and performing arts.
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:34.000]   This is a way for us to show everything that all our seniors have been working hard for.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:43.000]   This is for freshmen, software and juniors. We had band, in the dome, choir and dance, and our song team.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:53.000]   We also hosted an alumni baseball game. We had close to 100 people, alumni and students, involved in the game. It was a lot of fun.
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:01.000]   We also had our OHS medical pathway students go to UCI with the Yorology department.
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:10.000]   Apologize if I said that wrong. But it was a great way for students to learn how to be active in that pathway and career.
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:24.000]   We also hosted a parent university teaching our parents of our Panthers about college applications, fast forward information at our senior events, like graduation schedules, and grad night.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:32.000]   And we're also going to host a fast forward workshop for our parents, February 24th from 8 to 12.
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:41.000]   And this week, we have our WASP visit during March.
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:50.000]   And this week, we have a pep rally to announce our Warner formal core. Our Warner formal theme is fantasy ball, similar to Valentine's theme.
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:54.000]   We're also going to have a band that I'm really excited about that.
[02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:55.000]   Thank you.
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:56.000]   Thank you.
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:10.000]   Good evening, President Rachega, Superintendent Gonzalez and Board members.
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:16.000]   So we don't have a busy week like that for anybody else, but we're doing a few things.
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:24.000]   So we're welcoming our new career team Ms. Leofsky, I think so. Sorry, if that's your name.
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:33.000]   For Valentine's Day, we are doing a few things. So first off, for now, we just finished working on door decorating.
[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:39.000]   It's been raining a lot, so I don't know where people are like putting their posters, but we made like door decorating posters.
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:50.000]   And we're also, we are also starting to sell candy grams. They keep their little, like, daily little cards and also a lot of bad candies.
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:55.000]   And then we're also doing, we did a newly weds game for RHTV.
[02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:07.000]   Basically, we got couples and bestie duos, and they answered a few questions at the end, whoever had the most points got the Starbucks gift card.
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:12.000]   And then we did do lolly complements, which is like lolly pops with complements.
[02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:18.000]   We went around the school and gave them to some students and had them read them. So it will be on the RHTV YouTube channel.
[02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000]   We guys want to look that up.
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:29.000]   And then we're also doing Valentine's Day Friday, which is like kind of like a little game thingy.
[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:35.000]   And we're going to be playing, we're going to pick up like little candies with chopsticks.
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:39.000]   We're also going to do Kenny Tower in a water balloon toss.
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:47.000]   And then last but not least, we're, sorry, it's a constant appreciation week this week.
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:53.000]   So we're going to be surprising this Rodriguez tomorrow with the three things throughout the day.
[02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:59.000]   I don't want to give out too much detail because I don't want to say it's a surprise.
[02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000]   So yeah, thank you.
[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:06.000]   Thank you.
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:13.000]   Good evening, everybody. I know we're only a few days into February, but we've had a lot going on on our campus per usual.
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:18.000]   But the last few weeks, we've had fast flow workshops hosted for our seniors.
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:24.000]   And that was hosted by our SEC representatives, and they presented in our English and Govan econ classes.
[02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:27.000]   And I found those to be very helpful.
[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:33.000]   Our Red Cross Club also hosted their second blood drive of this academic year.
[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:39.000]   And there was a lot of participation and we gave a lot of blood, so that was really exciting.
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:48.000]   And then our Vanguard Dance Company, which is our varsity dance team performed this weekend at last weekend at the Halo Dance for Autism event,
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:56.000]   which is where a bunch of other high schools come together and we all danced and all of the proceeds go directly to families impacted from autism.
[02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:03.000]   And the theater was quite packed. There was only a few seats left, so I'm really excited to see how much money was raised from that.
[02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:09.000]   And then our ELMO showcase, like was mentioned earlier, that was yesterday for all of our feeder schools.
[02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:19.000]   So Santa Barbara and Pearson came and in our gym, we had all of our sports teams with their tables and their awards to present to our new incoming students.
[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:26.000]   And then in our library, we had the CCE Pathways. I got to present dance instances, a CCE pathway and a varsity sport.
[02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:34.000]   And we also had performances by our high school teams and our VAPA areas, which is like dance, cheer and palm.
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:40.000]   And then some of the middle school students also were able to perform, so I enjoyed watching that as well.
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:49.000]   And we are continuing to work on our spirit week, which is coming up in March, as everyone knows if you've ever heard of ELMO, it's like our biggest event we do.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:59.000]   So we have work days that are ongoing for that. And we have a Valentine's Day coffee night tomorrow night, and that's for all of our VAPA teams to perform.
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:04.000]   So choir and band and all of that, and any student can perform in that.
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:12.000]   And they will be selling Valentine's Day grams, which are they're singing Valentine's and it's my favorite thing choir does probably.
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:20.000]   It's where they deliver a gram on Valentine's Day and they will sing to not only the person they're delivering it to, but the whole entire class.
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:23.000]   So I'm really excited to send some of those out.
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:31.000]   And lastly, I wanted to congratulate our girls water polo and our girls and boys wrestling teams for making it to CIF.
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:38.000]   [Applause]
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000]   Good evening, everyone.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:45.000]   So about a week ago, we had our winter prep rally, and it was really fun.
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:52.000]   We had a few dance performances from our winter season sports, and we had a lot of games.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:57.000]   I think the crowd favorite game was blindfolded musical chairs with the teachers.
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:02.000]   It was really fun to watch, as you can imagine, it was very entertaining.
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:16.000]   As for our winter sports, we have girls water polo, boys soccer, girls and boys basketball, all qualifying for CIF championships with boys basketball and round two as of last night.
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:25.000]   And our girls and boys wrestling have 14 players qualified for individual championships for CIF this season as well.
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:31.000]   And in addition, we have our cheer and song teams going to Florida for nationals this month.
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:41.000]   And our varsity song team is having a showcase in the big gym on February 15th at 7 p.m. if anyone wants to go and support.
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:48.000]   We had club carnival today, and it's going on tomorrow.
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.000]   It's basically where every club on campus, we have about 100 clubs.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:36:01.000]   They all set up a booth, and they advertise their clubs to all the students, and the students can walk around and join whatever clubs they want.
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.000]   So that's always a highlight of the month. We do that twice a year.
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:14.000]   And then, as you mentioned earlier, we have our annual Canyon High School showcase on Wednesday, February 21st.
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:19.000]   And everyone is welcome to come and see everything that Canyon has to offer.
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:26.000]   The feeder schools will be in the quad from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m., and then everything else will be from 6 to 7 p.m.
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000]   So thank you.
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:33.000]   Thank you so much.
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:57.000]   Okay, on to CTE month proclamation.
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:02.000]   And this is Lisa, right? As you all know.
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:06.000]   And I understand how you speak up here, so it's kind of challenging.
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:23.000]   February 20, '24 has been designated National Career and Technical Education CTE month to honor students who have chosen to pursue career in technical education as a means of acquiring real-world skills to compete in the workforce.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:32.000]   And so I offer this proclamation on behalf of the Board of Education on a unified for CTE month itself.
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:36.000]   So if you'd like to say a few words.
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:43.000]   I just want to say thank you, I'm Board President Ortega, Board Members, Cabinet, our community, our students, and teachers.
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.000]   We just want to thank you all for all of your support for career technical education.
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:52.000]   Career technical education serves such an important purpose for our students.
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:59.000]   It really gives them engaging environments to learn in where they're learning technical skills along with their academic skills.
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:04.000]   And it really prepares our students for the high demand, high wage jobs of the future.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:09.000]   So we really feel in orange unified that CTE is making our students future ready.
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:27.000]   So thank you.
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.000]   Mr. Gonzalez.
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000]   On item 14.
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:33.000]   Thank you.
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:38.000]   Ms. Neville will present on this item.
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:39.000]   Good evening.
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:44.000]   Tonight we celebrate our You've Got the Edge Employee of the Month program for February.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:51.000]   Two awards are given each month during the school year to employees who exemplify one or more of the district's core values.
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:39:01.000]   This month we recognize JJ Hall, teacher of Pamirah Gate Magnet, and Karina Hernandez, instructional assistant at Levita Elementary School.
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:06.000]   Both JJ and Karina were surprised at their school sites with news of the recognition.
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:17.000]   They are awarded with a customized OUSD tumbler, gift cards from schools for its federal credit union, and the Orange Unified Public Schools Foundation, and a framed employee of the month certificate.
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:22.000]   Additionally, their portraits will be displayed in the external display case outside the boardrooms.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:27.000]   We have a slide to this evening to highlight each of our honorees.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:32.000]   First we have the honor of surprising JJ Hall, teacher of Pamirah Gate Magnet.
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.000]   Principal Christina Blederman had this to say about JJ.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.000]   JJ exemplifies Orange Unified's core value of excellence.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:45.000]   She is a positive, influential force on campus and a school site leader.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:48.000]   She is also an outstanding special education teacher.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:54.000]   Her instructional skillset creates positive learning opportunities for her students and meets their academic needs.
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:58.000]   She is over and above to meet all students' varied needs.
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:02.000]   The work JJ does with each student and how she interacts with parents is notable.
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:08.000]   JJ represents all the core values of OUSD, but excellence is her standout trait.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:13.000]   Pamirah is fortunate to have JJ as part of the team.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:21.000]   Next we have the honor of surprising Karina Hernandez, instructional assistant at Levita Elementary School.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:24.000]   Principal Anna Marhaga had this to say about Karina.
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:27.000]   Karina is a highly valued staff member at Levita.
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:31.000]   Not only does Karina support the instructional program within the TK classroom,
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.000]   but she also provides endless support for the youngest students on campus.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:42.000]   Karina can turn any TK frown upside down with her magical skillset.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:49.000]   She consistently goes out of her way to ensure the TK students feel safe, loved and valued at Levita.
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:56.000]   We are proud of Karina as part of our team and we thank her for the impact she makes on students and the overall culture of our school.
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:01.000]   Both JJ and Karina are watching with their family and friends at home this evening
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:07.000]   and are recording a message with the communications team that will be shared on OUSD's social media platforms.
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:11.000]   So that's a little plug. If you want to follow us on Instagram, check us out.
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:20.000]   Congratulations again to JJ Hall and Karina Hernandez and thank you both for your dedication and devotion to the students of the Orange Unified School District.
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:29.000]   [Applause]
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:33.000]   Okay, on to six.
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:38.000]   We have 14 comments on item 7A.
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000]   Okay.
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000]   Let's proceed.
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.000]   I'm sorry.
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:44.000]   14.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:45.000]   14.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:46.000]   So two minutes each.
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:47.000]   Yes.
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:52.000]   I'm going to call a couple of you, Jay Hickman.
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:53.000]   Okay.
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:57.000]   Aristan.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000]   Samara.
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000]   Alexander Tran.
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000]   Jimmy Fock.
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000]   And Ella Chang.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000]   Do you want to line up, please?
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:13.000]   So first up is Jay Hickman.
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:18.000]   Good evening OUSD board members, parents, student, and concerned parties.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000]   My name is Jay Hickman.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000]   I'm a sophomore at Villa Park High School.
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:25.000]   I assume for the Villa Parks Bar and Swim team.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:30.000]   I'm here tonight to give my support for building a 15-meter swimming pool at Villa Park High School.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:35.000]   A pool that we deserve and that is long overdue.
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:39.000]   Building a 15-meter pool is not just for the high school, but it's for the community.
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:43.000]   There's no doubt that Villa Park High School needs a new pool.
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:44.000]   Ours is outdated.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:45.000]   Tows are broken.
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000]   The plaster is chipped.
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.000]   The pump and heater are outdated and break too often.
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:43:00.000]   Building a 15-meter pool is the only clear choice as it offers so much versatility compared to a 25-yard or 30-meter pool like El Medina's pool.
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:08.000]   With a 15-meter pool, the high school can run swimming and water pool practices at the same time smaller pools cannot.
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:16.000]   We will be able to host big swimming and water pool implementations that would be impossible in a small facility.
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:28.000]   I'm sure that the local businesses at the Villa Park Town Center will enjoy having 400+ competitors and their parents seeking food options at their establishments.
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:42.000]   In closing, I would like to restate that the Villa Park High School needs to be replaced.
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:45.000]   It's outdated and in despair.
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000]   A 15-meter pool is the only clear choice.
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:52.000]   It is more versatile and more functional and more profitable than a smaller pool.
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:44:06.000]   With the help of the City of Villa Park and Villa Park High School aquatics promoting a vast array of aquatics programs, I already mentioned the OUSD will see the success of the pool.
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.000]   The Villa Park community and business will benefit and the Villa Park Aquatics Program will thrive.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:12.000]   Thank you for your time.
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:21.000]   Aristan?
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:29.000]   Good evening board.
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:32.000]   My name is Aristan Dillion as a 10th grader at Villa Park High School.
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:37.000]   And so I remember I urge you to approve the Olympics High School to be built at Villa Park High.
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:46.000]   Approval will reflect a long-term vision that can be creative and flexible, that can envision collaboration with our OUSD high schools in the cities of Orange and Villa Park.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:53.000]   Not only to support our own students, but also provide opportunities to gain not just the partnerships, but financial profits as well.
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.000]   Having been personally trained at Irvine Willett Aquatic Center, I know it can be done.
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:01.000]   Irvine High has access to two Olympic-sized pools and is expanding.
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:07.000]   Irvine has profitability in working with their schools, city and community that has benefited even me and Outsider.
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:12.000]   However, both the girls and boys, Villa Park Some teams were lead champions last year.
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:16.000]   We need to invest in Villa Park High School Aquatics now.
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:21.000]   Please consider the privilege of having the first and only long-class pool in OUSD and the benefits it offers.
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:24.000]   The experts have said our current pool needs to be replaced.
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:25.000]   I'm appealing to all of you.
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:26.000]   It is our turn.
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:27.000]   Please say yes to the pool.
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:28.000]   Again, thank you.
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:39.000]   Is it Samara or Samaritan?
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:40.000]   Samara.
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:42.000]   Hello, boredom.
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:43.000]   Thank you for hearing me.
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:47.000]   I'm Samaritan Leon, fifth grader at BPE, and I'm a swimmer too.
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:50.000]   Training with Orca along with my two older siblings.
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:55.000]   I want my brother and my sister who are both in Villa Park High to have the great pool, the best pool.
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:58.000]   When I reach high school in three years, I'd like to swim here too.
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:02.000]   If you are not a swimmer, I want you to know that in swimming, size does matter.
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000]   Even I figured that out.
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:09.000]   My first time competing in a long course was weird because I practiced in a short course pool.
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:12.000]   The Olympic standard is the long course pool.
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:16.000]   Our high schoolers are competing in long course now.
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:24.000]   In our high schools, football, baseball, basketball, soccer, even track and field, to name a few, compete in both size fields.
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000]   Just like the crowds, we can do the same for swimming.
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:31.000]   We can attract many of the best swimmers to come to Villa Park High.
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:37.000]   Just as OUSD supports many sports, I hope that this time you can improve a really good pool.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:42.000]   That will be the best for a long time for our community and others. Thank you.
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:47.000]   [Applause]
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000]   Good evening board trustees.
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:54.000]   Alexander Tran, Orchard High School District Student Board Member for Villa Park High School.
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:00.000]   I recall that a little over a year ago, we first discussed the issues with the Villa Park pool during the February meeting.
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:07.000]   I had the opportunity to set Pro Tempoor for former student board member, Hope Camero.
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:12.000]   A little over a year ago, a little over a year later, we continued to use that facility.
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:18.000]   And a little over a year later, we continued to bicker over the politics that disturbed this aquatic center.
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:23.000]   A little over a year ago, estimations put us at $28 million for this project.
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000]   Today, it is almost $60 million.
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:32.000]   Millions of dollars which could have been invested back into our students, now dispersed only to the skeptics.
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:35.000]   For the skeptics, I shall say this.
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:39.000]   The only way to protect public education is to enhance it.
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:42.000]   And the first step to achieve that is with this aquatic center.
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:48.000]   From the start of this conversation, the question has never been about conflicts of interest for there is currently none.
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:55.000]   From the start of this conversation, the question has never been about fiscal responsibility for we would have a remainder of $15 million in a facilities fund.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:59.000]   But from the start of this conversation, it has always been what is right and what is wrong.
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:04.000]   And it is unanimous that the deprivation of this aquatic facility is most certainly the latter.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:09.000]   I urge the board to continue viewing this matter with that exact lens and make the right decision.
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000]   Thank you very much.
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:15.000]   [Applause]
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:24.000]   Okay, I have Jimmy, Ella, Gavin Cortez, Lucy, and then John Sinks.
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000]   Members of the Board of Education.
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:31.000]   My name is Jimmy Falk, and I have been involved in student leadership for many years at various OUSD schools.
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:37.000]   Villa Park Elementary, Sarah Villa Middle School, and now here at Villa Park High School.
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:43.000]   I believe that adequate facilities are fundamental to our athletes and the environment that begets them.
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:47.000]   This has previously been true for our aquatic program here at Villa Park High School,
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:52.000]   which has begotten the most Olympic swimmers out of any high school in the county of Orange.
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:49:02.000]   I say previously true, as unfortunately many of our athletes within the area have fled or unified to neighboring districts where their facilities are actually up to date.
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:06.000]   By approving this pool, this is an opportunity to attract and retain,
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:12.000]   potentially bringing in tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars for our OUSD schools.
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:24.000]   As an athlete who is not in aquatics, I use the pool for track and then our other athletic programs such as PE and many other sports around our school also use the pool,
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:30.000]   so it will be beneficial just not for aquatic students but for other athletics around the campus.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:34.000]   Villa Park High School is special, and we house the ORCA program.
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:39.000]   For many, the Villa Park pool is considered home, but we need renovations severely.
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:44.000]   This is an investment not just in the public education of our students but for our schools.
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000]   Please approve the pool. Thank you.
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:53.000]   [Applause]
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:59.000]   Ella Chang.
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:06.000]   Dear OUSD board, my name is Ella Chang, and as Freshman Class President, I would like to state my full support for this aquatic center.
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:11.000]   Having friends in our aquatic program, I recognize the importance that this new facility would have for them.
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:17.000]   Besides our swimming polo kits, hundreds of students in various sports teams and PE classes use our pool.
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:25.000]   This facility is the center of our campus, and to have this 50-meter pool will be an exemplary form of our advancement and investments in our students.
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000]   Please approve the pool. Thank you.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:33.000]   [Applause]
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:37.000]   Gavin.
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:42.000]   Dear members of the board, my name is Gavin Cortez, and I am currently Freshman Class President at Villa Park High School.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:49.000]   Although I do not play polo or swim, I stand in full solidarity for the pool with my full students who do play in our amazing aquatic program.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:52.000]   As a student athlete, I understand the importance of having up-to-date facilities.
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:58.000]   They provide not only a safe athletic environment but one that allows our athletes to prosper both personally and academically.
[02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:02.000]   Members of the board, I vote for our pool as a vote for our students. Thank you.
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:06.000]   [Applause]
[02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000]   Lucy.
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:14.000]   And then John Sanks, Alex Broussard, Jenny Sloan, and Missy.
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:17.000]   Oh, and then Nicole Jones, sorry.
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:22.000]   Good evening, Mr. Superintendent, President Rotega, and esteemed members of the board.
[02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:26.000]   My name is Lucy Flynn, and I am a sophomore at Villa Park High School.
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:34.000]   I've been swimming for 10 out of the 16 years of my life, and I would really appreciate if you guys could approve the new pool.
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:39.000]   Many of you may not realize that aquatics is not a small community.
[02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:47.000]   It is actually rather large, and a new pool would benefit our school in more ways than one.
[02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:57.000]   I would really just like to say that it's the right decision, and it's the way to go, and I do believe that we need this pool sooner rather than later. Thank you.
[02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:05.000]   [Applause]
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:13.000]   I'm a parent. I'm a homeowner, and I understand that you need the pool, and you're moving forward with this,
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:19.000]   but I do have some questions because I want to make sure that as the school district moves forward, there's adequate cost controls that are in place here.
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:26.000]   So if I'm understanding this right, you're planning to give an award to the construction contractor who would ultimately build the pool.
[02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:33.000]   Tonight, you're planning to authorize about $45,000 in pre-construction expenditures out of a $13 million plan construction cost.
[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:40.000]   That's what's in the draft resolution. That's about 0.3% of the fee that has been negotiated at this time.
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:47.000]   There were full costs for the final construction submitted with the proposals that nap in the other scent, and so what are they?
[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:54.000]   Is there any kind of an enforceable cost commitment that's being established on the -- on the -- on that construction that's going to go into place today?
[02:52:54.000 --> 02:53:01.000]   What I don't understand is how have we determined that they're the best value contractor at this time if the final design is incomplete?
[02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:06.000]   How complete is the design? Are we 10, 50, 90? That's not reflected in the agenda description tonight.
[02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:15.000]   If we do award this, are we losing the ability to solicit competitive bids on the full design once the actual design is in place?
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000]   This is the majority of the cost.
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:27.000]   What I'm wondering is why are we not using a third-party construction manager or engineering-type firm to go and do these pre-construction services that need to be completed
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:37.000]   and then use that to prepare a final design and then put the construction out to bids so they can have competitive cost proposals from everybody who might be interested in building this facility.
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:43.000]   It feels like you're putting the cart before the horse by awarding construction before the fee has been properly established.
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:50.000]   So I just want to make sure we have the proper financial controls in place as you move forward with this construction. Thank you.
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:54.000]   [Applause]
[02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:59.000]   Okay, I have Alex, then Jenny, then Missy, then Nicole Jones.
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:12.000]   My name is Alex Brousa. I am a parent and a student in the district. I'm a homeowner in the district.
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:26.000]   The reason that I'm speaking to this item is because just this last April, a Riverside County judge sentenced Ted Rossi, a former assistant superintendent of Corona Norco Unified,
[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:34.000]   to state prison on charges that he embezzled more than $1 million in money earmarked for school construction projects.
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:41.000]   He faced 31 felony counts of money laundering and other charges stemming from his time as facility's director.
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:51.000]   According to the plea he reached, he would order a construction firm to shift money from one school project to another by depositing money into his personal account.
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:55.000]   Now, why does this matter? You know, everybody's wondering what's going on with this?
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:12.000]   Because of that, neph construction was implicated in that fraud. The Riverside County Office of Education produced a report that was emailed to you earlier today regarding the Corona Norco Unified School District.
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:23.000]   It's over 70 pages. And what I'd like to know is whether these actions by neph construction were considered in awarding them this contract.
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:41.000]   Did you consider that they participated previously in fraud before awarding them a contract of which you're authorizing $44,000 and then trusting them that they're going to go and do the rest without upcharging you without doing any of that?
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:47.000]   Now, why is this being rushed so much? It was previously mentioned that ORCA uses the facility.
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:54.000]   John Ortega has a family member that swims for ORCA and reportedly another one that works there.
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:56:06.000]   So is John Ortega benefiting his family? I don't know. These questions need to be asked. These things don't need to be rushed. This is a lot of money, guys. Do better.
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:25.000]   You're on record for slander's remarks on that. Mr. Ortega, you don't understand. You need to check with your mic. It's cut off. No, it's not. No, it's not.
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:39.000]   Go sit down. You are done. You're done now to water. Now sit down. Jenny Sloan and then Missy and then Nicole Jones.
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:52.000]   Members of the board, I'm a parent of two OEC kids. I own a home. I pay taxes. Look, I know the pool is in bad shape and it needs to be replaced. All of our pools are aging.
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:57:07.000]   Yeah, everyone has a great pool. And the reason is because they pass bond measures everywhere that they need pools, which are huge expenses. They pass bond measures and bond measures are agreed upon by voters, taxpayers, parents, you know, parents rights.
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:24.000]   So we can't just take our basic money that's supposed to go to infrastructure for all kinds of other repairs and just decide that we need this pool like right now. Because we have plans. There is a plan to fix up our elementary schools, many of which were built in the 60s and 70s.
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:35.000]   This plan has been in the books for years. It was finished in 2021. You can go look it up online. It is ready to go. We know exactly what we're going to fix and where, but we can't do it because we're going to build a pool.
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:46.000]   And I understand you need a pool. You have to get the community to agree. It's too much money to just kind of grab money out of the fund. You have to go to the voters. This is the way it's done in all the other cities that have great pools.
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:58:03.000]   Yes, kids have left our schools because of this because the other cities got their stuff together and got the bond measures passed.
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:21.000]   Good evening, board trustees. My name is Messy and I was born and raised in Orange. In ninth grade, I joined the swim team at El Medina High School. In tenth grade, we started the very first girls water polo team. I spent a large portion of my high school career inside of the Alamo pool.
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:38.000]   The aquatics community is such an incredible community to be a part of. It's unfortunate to hear that the Villa Park pool continually breaks down and needs to be fixed. I feel for these swimmers whose practices can be very rigorous with multiple per day.
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:53.000]   Having to skip can make a big difference, especially when training for big meets or water polo tournaments. As an OUSD resident and taxpayer, I find this to be unacceptable. And I'm so glad that you've been searching diligently for a solution.
[02:58:53.000 --> 02:59:02.000]   I urge you to vote yes on the Villa Park Aquatics Center project. I would also like to note how important it is to approve a 50 meter pool.
[02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:20.000]   This will be a wonderful asset to the OUSD Aquatics community at large. OUSD will be able to host multi-level practices at once, as well as host imitations, which will expand the Aquatics program within OUSD. Please vote yes to approve this pool. Thank you so much for your time.
[02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:39.000]   Superintendent Gonzalez and Board, I am the parent of three past and current OUSD Aquatics athletes, and they're the second generation in my family to swim at Villa Park High School.
[02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:55.000]   When I first started my kids in this district at Villa Park Elementary, a friend of mine was told by an OUSD employee that Villa Park would never have nicer schools and orange, because they didn't want that perception out there in the community.
[02:59:55.000 --> 03:00:12.000]   Unfortunately, in my experience in OUSD for almost 20 years, I have absolutely found that to be true. It has been all too easy for El Medina parents to get up here and argue against a pool for Villa Park with their new stadium, their new baseball facilities, and their new pool.
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:28.000]   Villa Park High School has zero standalone signature programs. When I asked a district administrator what VP's signature program was, because they said we had one, I was told it was the Spider Lab, the Spider Lab that all our other high schools have as well.
[03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:34.000]   That is not the same thing as Canyon's unique aviation program or El Medina's culinary program.
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:54.000]   Villa Park students deserve something that makes us unique from the other schools in our district. Our kids should not be second-class citizens. Our pool is down right now. We do not have a pool to use. We do not know where we are going to be starting our swim season.
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:01:10.000]   Now you finally have a chance to make a difference for our kids. Please approve a 50-meter pool at Villa Park High School.
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:30.000]   Okay, thank you for your comments, all of you. On to 7A for the authorization of the award for the RFP 2324-911. That's a good one.
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:44.000]   Thank you, President Ortega, distinguished board members. We have started a process back in August when we met with the board to talk about a lease-lease back as a delivery method.
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:58.000]   We then subsequently, the board showed interest. We passed board resolutions, board policies to allow us to use that delivery method.
[03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:14.000]   We have also gone through a process, an RFP process, an extensive process to work with our purchasing team and our legal team to identify potential bidders for the project.
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:30.000]   We allowed Mr. Yeoman to explain what that was. He was our counsel sitting on the interviews. He has, my understanding, he has processed over 100 RFP processes for a lease-lease back.
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:38.000]   So we're happy to have someone with his level of experience having done this for a number of years.
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:48.000]   I'll refer this to Mr. Yeoman to be able to answer any questions and I think address some of the concerns that we just heard from the community.
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000]   So I'll turn it over to Mr. Yeoman.
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:03:09.000]   Thank you so much. The lease-lease back has been a very popular delivery method for at least 15, 20 years, and as Mr. Rivera said, I've probably done more than 100 of RFPs using the lease-lease back.
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:29.000]   And I think the main takeaway is that using lease-lease back allows for an early collaboration between the selected contractor and the architect to try to develop the site plans, the drawings, contain the costs.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:45.000]   And so, and they're working toward DSA approval. So by the time they get DSA approval, they have collaborated on all the aspects leading up to establishing what the guaranteed maximum price is going to be.
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:56.000]   And then the board, through another resolution, would approve the construction, but only after the DSA is given its approval.
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:06.000]   It differs from the design bid bill that another speaker had mentioned because there you have your DSA approval before you go out to bid.
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:13.000]   But you lose the ability for that early collaboration to try to save money going into the process.
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:27.000]   And the design bid bill is also a more confrontational process where you have change orders, and upon the design bid bill, it's just more confrontational.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:39.000]   You have more issues that are coming up. Where on the lease-lease back, in my experience, it's almost always very collaborative, and almost always the bunnies are left over.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:50.000]   They come back to the district at the end, very seldom, in my experience, is the whole GMP actually used.
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:05:01.000]   And so a lot of times it's also done quicker, too, because you are, you're having all the central parties working together for a common good.
[03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:12.000]   And so it's been a very successful process that districts have been using up and down the state, and there's probably been thousands of them done very successfully.
[03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:18.000]   And the thought was, is that this would be an ideal project to try to use the lease-lease back on.
[03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:30.000]   So that was the reason why in August, you know, I did the presentation talking about the process, and then the board policy was put in place that shows what the evaluation criteria is,
[03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:36.000]   which was also set forth in the RFP that was issued, and it's the best value.
[03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:41.000]   So you're looking at their qualifications, what their experience is.
[03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:49.000]   They're based upon, they're giving their estimates based upon what the architect's estimates are for the project.
[03:05:49.000 --> 03:06:02.000]   And that's where the $13 million team is a potential estimated guaranteed maximum price based upon all the figures that the architect was dealing with.
[03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:12.000]   And so all the people that were proposing were using that figure so they give what their profits and what their lease-lease back.
[03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:23.000]   What are their construction costs are all based upon that estimated GMP. If they thought it was really low, they would not even be bidding on it.
[03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:26.000]   They would not be submitting a proposal.
[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:35.000]   We had eight different entities, I believe show up at the mandatory previous conference at Phillip Park High School.
[03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:43.000]   We all went through it, and of those we had four different entities that submitted a proposal.
[03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:56.000]   We used the criteria that was set forth in the board policy 3311.2, and we had interviews with the top three contenders based upon the pricing.
[03:06:56.000 --> 03:07:11.000]   And of those, net construction was the highest point and was ultimately selected by the committee with the recommendation then set forth in the resolution coming before the board.
[03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:20.000]   So tonight, the only thing that would be done is that you'd be awarding a project and authorizing the pre-construction phase.
[03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:25.000]   And the pre-construction phase does not involve any construction activities.
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:32.000]   It doesn't involve any work that would require a license, any work that would require DSA approval.
[03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:42.000]   So this is all collaboration with the architect trying to get the best set of plans and specifications that they can in order to go forward.
[03:07:42.000 --> 03:08:03.000]   It's only after DSA approves the plans a second resolution would come forward to the board with what they agreed upon guaranteeing that the price is with the authority then to approve that DMP and authorize the construction phase.
[03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:11.000]   If the DMP is out of budget that comes up with the contractor said, "No, we can't afford that."
[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:17.000]   There's no obligation on the board to go further. You can pull the plug right then and there.
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:32.000]   The RFP is clear on that, at least leaseback documents are clear on that, at which point the only commitment that you would have would be the $45,000 that would be authorized as part of the pre-construction phase.
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:52.000]   So there's little risk, but at the same time there's a significant benefit by bringing in the contractor early on the process to really work and collaborate with the architect and have the best pricing that you possibly can have.
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:09:15.000]   I just want to clarify for the board, the committee that was involved in the selection process, beside Mr. Yeoman, our council, we had our senior director purchasing and contracts and our assistant director purchasing and contracts participate as well as our new senior executive director of facilities, Mrs. Bosquez, which is here tonight.
[03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:22.000]   So those are the four individuals that participated in this legal process.
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:35.000]   Thank you so much, really appreciate it. And so what that said is you outlined perfectly, as both Mr. Rivera and Mr. Yeoman has elaborated, this has been since last August.
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:50.000]   We've gone through the process, we've had the meetings, we've shared with the public everything that was occurring, going to occur and how, kind of the who, what, where, when, and how this was going to play itself out.
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:10:09.000]   So this isn't anything new at all. No one's been kept in the dark about anything. It's been a complete and open process as we've come forward and shared a tremendous amount of information not only with the board, but also with the public.
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:25.000]   So with that said, I will make the motion to approve item 7A. Is there a second? Are you going to ask questions or anything? Hold on a second. Mr. Ledezma, second. On to discussion.
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:46.000]   So I just want to clarify because I want to clarify because there has been some misinformation put out into the public that this board adopted or approved a $16 million 15-meter pool. That is untrue, correct?
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:47.000]   That is correct.
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:52.000]   Okay, so we have not approved a $16 million pool that never happened.
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:11:07.000]   Yeah, the only time you're going to approve anything is when you have DSA approval, the contractor that's been selected comes forward with a guaranteed maximum price that is acceptable to the district and the board within your budget.
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:16.000]   Okay. And in that RFP, the estimated project cost was $18,350,000, correct?
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:20.000]   No, the RFP said $13 million.
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:21.000]   The RFP?
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:22.000]   Yeah.
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:33.000]   Okay, I have a copy of it here and it shows that the project cost is estimated to be $18,350,000.
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:42.000]   That was updated. That's not the latest one. That's not what was submitted to all the potential bidders.
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:49.000]   We're talking about project, not construction.
[03:11:49.000 --> 03:12:09.000]   It's exhibit A attached to the RFP.
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:35.000]   The RFP itself has the cost budget of $13 million, and so I think the exhibit you have takes in all the soft costs and things that would be in addition to these, including, you know, the project, you know, $1 million for the Mertha pool.
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:36.000]   Right.
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:44.000]   So the $13 million is just the construction company's estimation of what their price is going to be. That's not the project cost.
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:47.000]   Not the entire cost. That's correct.
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:48.000]   That was my question.
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:49.000]   I'm sorry.
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:13:01.000]   Yeah. So the project itself can erratically go up to $18,350,000 based on our RFP as long as it fits into that budget. That's what we've approved so far.
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:06.000]   Again, that's what they were basing their proposals on.
[03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:07.000]   Okay. That's my question.
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:17.000]   When you have to say approval, there may be certain things going through this pre-construction phase, or they can save money that will bring that price down too.
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:20.000]   But there can also be things that can make the price go up.
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:21.000]   Definitely.
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:29.000]   So you have things like soil sampling. Avila Park is a huge problem, which we've lived with for a long time.
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:36.000]   That soil sampling and all of that, that doesn't happen before it goes to DSA, does it?
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:44.000]   No. I mean, that would all be part of what DSA would be looking at and approving that would have to be completed as part of the project.
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:54.000]   If they just look at the plans, they're not going to look at all, like these other unexpected costs can come up, and that can affect the overall price.
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:59.000]   There will be different studies, I'm sure, that will be done during the pre-construction phase and everything.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:06.000]   Well, we don't know that because it's not in here. It doesn't require them to do soil, for instance, soil sampling.
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:11.000]   Because DSA is probably not going to get the plans by the schedule until August.
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:17.000]   So there's going to be a lot going on between now and the time DSA ever even sees the plans and specs.
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:23.000]   And so only after that do all the figures go hard.
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:32.000]   DSA approves plans and specs. They look at it, they say you have all the ADA requirements, you have this is the right size for the space.
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:36.000]   They don't do the individual things that come up during construction.
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:45.000]   We know because we've been doing, you know, as a rest for a long time, things that change orders all the time that happen, right, in a normal process.
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:46.000]   That's correct.
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:55.000]   Okay, and if those things come up and it exceeds the budget for whatever reason, then we have to renegotiate that sort of.
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:15:04.000]   We could sure say, no, we won't do it, or we're, you know, $18 million into the pool, okay, here's another million dollars for the project.
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:06.000]   That can happen, correct?
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:19.000]   Yes, and no, there's the least respect for projects and the documents have contingencies, have a district contingency, and as a construction contingency, the price to eliminate some of those unknowns that could come in.
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:23.000]   But they're built into the guaranteed maximum price.
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:30.000]   So any portion to that which is not used by the end of the project comes right back to the district.
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:38.000]   So you're saying that there's nothing that could surprise, I mean, I've been talking to architects and I've been talking to construction people and they say, yeah, these things happen.
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:44.000]   I mean, at least least back is great, but it's no guarantee.
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:48.000]   Things happen all the time that might adjust that ultimate price, correct?
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:16:03.000]   That's true, I mean, for instance, I mean, even just based on like a $10 million GMP, 5%, that's what we have for our, excuse me, contingencies for the construction and district, that'd be $500,000 for each of those.
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:13.000]   It'd be a million dollars potential that would, could absorb some of the unforeseen things that may come up during the course of the construction.
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:17.000]   All right, I have another question, but I don't know if this is actually for you.
[03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:20.000]   So I'm going to actually hold off on that question really quick.
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:23.000]   I'm really concerned about a couple of aspects.
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:35.000]   So it says, obviously, we're going to enter into the construction services agreement, which includes provisions of which the selected contractor shall comply with respect to construction of the project.
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:43.000]   That doesn't have to be in this document, correct? We're choosing to have that in this document that we're awarding it ahead of time.
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:49.000]   These are all the least least back documents are comprised of the site lease, sub lease and construction services agreement.
[03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:54.000]   Those same three documents are in both pre construction and construction.
[03:16:54.000 --> 03:17:07.000]   They're in both pre construction and pre construction, but during the pre construction, the only things that are being done are in the site lease because you can't do anything that requires DSA approval or requires a license.
[03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000]   So they're put into the site lease.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:16.000]   Once you have the DSA approval, all the pre construction documents are amended and restated.
[03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:26.000]   And at that point in time, all the final construction requirements and what's going to go on are then folded into the construction services agreement.
[03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:27.000]   Okay.
[03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:32.000]   So, but we don't have to award a construction services agreement tonight.
[03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:34.000]   We could hold off and award that later.
[03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:38.000]   All you are awarding is the pre construction phase.
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:41.000]   You're not awarding any construction.
[03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:49.000]   We will also enter into a construction services agreement and in section two, it says subject to any revisions.
[03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:55.000]   The board hereby approves the form of the site lease, sub lease and construction services agreement.
[03:17:55.000 --> 03:17:58.000]   They're all part of the least least back documents.
[03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:14.000]   So we are adopting that today with this resolution. It says resolution of the board of education awarding Villa Park High School Aquatic Center project and authorizing awarding the Villa Park High School Aquatic Center project.
[03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:19.000]   So we're awarding the construction project by the language of this resolution.
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:21.000]   You're awarding the overall project.
[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:22.000]   That's correct.
[03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:49.000]   And a lot of that language, the reason that structure that it is, is to try to take into account like the Davis lawsuit and avoid any potential conflicts of interest where you award the pre construction, the preliminary services to one, and then therefore they can't bid on the next because they're using the information they glean in the first part to help them in the second.
[03:18:49.000 --> 03:19:00.000]   And that was part of what the Davis lawsuit and Chris was all about. And this avoids that because it's clear that everything is non construction related.
[03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:17.000]   You have the template documents, but you're not getting any bonds, not doing any performance payment bonds until you get to the construction phase because there's no construction being done until you give the authority to do the construction phase.
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:33.000]   Similarly, then you get the payment bond, you get the performance bond, and all the construction requirements are then within the construction services agreement and the plans and specs that are folded in as part of the construction documents.
[03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:39.000]   So when I look at this though and I look at section, I look at section four and I read section five as well.
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:57.000]   And it seems to me that it's that this never, this was not have to come back to this board for approval. You're saying that it will. Well, it says here the board hereby approves delegation of authority to the superintendent, who is hereby authorized and directed to negotiate,
[03:19:57.000 --> 03:20:07.000]   execute and deliver the sight lease agreement as provided above, et cetera, et cetera, all subject to the ratification of the board if necessary.
[03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:20.000]   And above that it says we're also delegating that the LLB documents will be amended and restated to include the final GMP agreed upon completion deadline for the project.
[03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:26.000]   So the way I read those we've delegated our authority to the superintendent.
[03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:32.000]   He can bring it back to us, but according to this it doesn't look like he has to bring it back to us.
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:43.000]   Not only because you can't take any action on DSA, you can't approve anything without DSA approval that requires a license or DSA by law, you can't do that.
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:51.000]   So that's why only the preconstruction that's not required those are being authorized by the board tonight. That's all.
[03:20:51.000 --> 03:21:01.000]   These are just form documents right now that will be used through the process, but the only thing that's being done is the $45,000.
[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:10.000]   That's in the site lease that talks about what they're going to be doing like in section nine of the site lease tells what's going to happen.
[03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:20.000]   In a constructive phase, all that disappears. It all then goes to the construction services agreement for the actual construction that requires DSA approval.
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:33.000]   So you're saying that even though we're entering into a construction services agreement and we're delegating authority to the superintendent subject to ratification by the board, and that the LOB documents will be amended and receded to final GMP,
[03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:40.000]   that even though that's not what you're saying, you're saying that's what it means? Like it's going to come back to us anyway?
[03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:55.000]   It doesn't read that way. Again, I don't understand the way it looks. It looks like it does not have to come back to the board for approval, that it can be approved by the superintendent to go forward.
[03:21:55.000 --> 03:22:12.000]   Only the pre-construction services are being awarded and I apologize if that's not clear, but that is the clear intent and that is what every single other lease lease back that I've done and those of other attorney's firms, that's the way that they're structured.
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:16.000]   Well, I mean, it seems like it should be clear when we're talking about this.
[03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:33.000]   Okay, so I have problems with that, but then I also do have one more question and I don't know if it goes to you or not, but I am concerned about the information regarding NEP.
[03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:53.000]   Obviously, a lease lease back is different from the lowest bid because we get to choose our own contractor and so some of the criticisms of that is that there can be things that are, you know, you could have a relationship with a construction company or something like that.
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:23:18.000]   That's just one of the things that people say, "Well, maybe that's not a good one," but I am concerned given, because I've read the Riverside County Office of Education and the FICMAT report and it says in there specifically that NEP failed to cooperate with the FICMAT audit and that there were 37 checks that were written to vendors directed by Rossi through NEP's
[03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:24.000]   facilitation and that amounted to $2.6 million.
[03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:52.000]   And then it's very detailed report. I mean, like a 60-cell-on-page report. That is of concern. I mean, did we know about this and we just -- it's not a big deal, or -- because to me, it's something I would want to know about that we're going to enter into this contract with somebody who dealt with somebody that was convicted for odd,
[03:23:52.000 --> 03:23:57.000]   like $2.6 million aid school facilities director.
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:24:13.000]   Right. I've got a question. Is that a big build process? Because at least this back -- I mean, this is where you're guaranteed a price. This is where there is no change orders.
[03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:24.000]   I mean, in these construction services that we're doing right now, is in order for us to take the step of creating that final price, right?
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:34.000]   That's correct. I mean, because you have the contenturities that are built into that guaranteed maximum price, and so you should not have change orders.
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:48.000]   And all the ones that I've done, I think I can count on one or -- I don't even know if I can count on any, or there's actually been a change order that has exceeded the contenturities that are built in the guaranteed maximum price.
[03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:49.000]   Right.
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:25:03.000]   Well, you just completely interrupted my question about now construction. Can I stay with this topic, and then -- Mr. Wyoming, can you quite address that? I wanted to just point out a couple things. I'm just trying to get some clarification.
[03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:05.000]   You're not the new board member here.
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:08.000]   I know, but I'm asking a very important question. You have --
[03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:10.000]   And as I am.
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:13.000]   I'm not John. I'm in the middle of the question.
[03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:21.000]   I can give a little bit of history on that, because I've represented Corona and ARCO for 36 years.
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:22.000]   Well --
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:29.000]   Don't give me the history right now. Just tell me, did anybody on our team know about this and not tell us?
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:32.000]   It was -- that I do not know.
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:37.000]   Well, did anybody on our staff know about this PICMAP report?
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:49.000]   And I understand that there was a criminal case, and the person pled guilty to so many counts, but that's a -- that's a different case. I've dealt with those cases.
[03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.000]   That was John Rossi.
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:52.000]   Correct.
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:56.000]   Andrew, are there any charges that were brought against him were dropped?
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:25:57.000]   Correct.
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:00.000]   And there were no charges whatsoever against neft construction?
[03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:03.000]   I am aware of that, but that's -- that's a different issue.
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:10.000]   Proving the crime to be under reasonable doubt is a much different issue than whether or not something funny happened.
[03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:23.000]   And I'm looking at the PICMAP report, which says this Rossi individual pled guilty to 37 counts or whatever it was, a fraud and embezzlement.
[03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:42.000]   And the grounds for that were checks written that were found to be -- found to be basically -- it drew the ire or the interest of the district because they were in the normal course of business.
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:51.000]   In fact, those 37 checks were actually written to this Rossi's credit card companies.
[03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:56.000]   And so criminal case aside, I've done that.
[03:26:56.000 --> 03:27:05.000]   And you can certainly be dismissed out of a criminal case, but that doesn't mean that it didn't happen or that it's not something we would address.
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:14.000]   Because I do think it's important to at least acknowledge that and talk about it where I literally found out about this today.
[03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:17.000]   And I don't understand that.
[03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:28.000]   Does it say that net construction was never implicated and there's been no districts based upon that sickment report that I'm aware of that have disqualified net construction from any construction project?
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:29.000]   They weren't implicated.
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:31.000]   They were implicated in this report.
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:32.000]   It went to the district attorney.
[03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:41.000]   The district attorney charged the net morrow with 37 felony counts as well.
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:44.000]   And ultimately the criminal case was dismissed.
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:53.000]   But if you look at the sickment report, like I said, it's 60 pages or more, he's certainly implicated in this.
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:28:01.000]   I mean, it's hard to square that I didn't do anything wrong with we have 37 checks that you wrote to this guy's credit card company.
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:10.000]   Anyway, I just want to know if that was something -- I am very reluctant to do anything until we're sure about that.
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:13.000]   And we have a lot more information on that.
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:18.000]   And I don't understand if you knew about it, why you wouldn't tell us about it?
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:19.000]   Like, that's a weird thing.
[03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:21.000]   Don't you think to not even --
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:23.000]   It was resolved years ago.
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:24.000]   Years ago.
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:28.000]   It was resolved last year, two years ago.
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:31.000]   All the different charges were completely dropped.
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:35.000]   The criminal charges, not anything dealing with sickment.
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:36.000]   You're talking about criminal charges.
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:37.000]   I agree with you.
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:38.000]   Fine.
[03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:47.000]   There's a very different standard between what a criminal conviction would require and what -- I mean, it was referred to the district attorney.
[03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:52.000]   The district attorney found there was enough probable cost to go ahead and file a complaint against them.
[03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:55.000]   I would like to hear what Mr. Young would like to say.
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:29:01.000]   I mean, I'm listening to -- I was going to say is the criminal charges were dropped from what I understand.
[03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:03.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:07.000]   I don't have a report.
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:09.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:11.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:13.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:13.000 --> 03:29:15.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:17.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:19.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:21.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:23.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:25.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:27.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:29.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:31.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:33.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:35.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:37.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:39.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:41.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:43.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:45.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:47.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:49.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:51.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:53.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:53.000 --> 03:29:55.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:55.000 --> 03:29:57.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:57.000 --> 03:29:59.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:29:59.000 --> 03:30:01.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:01.000 --> 03:30:03.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:03.000 --> 03:30:05.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:07.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:07.000 --> 03:30:09.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:11.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:11.000 --> 03:30:13.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:15.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:17.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:17.000 --> 03:30:19.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:19.000 --> 03:30:21.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:21.000 --> 03:30:23.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:23.000 --> 03:30:25.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:27.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:29.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:29.000 --> 03:30:31.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:33.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:35.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:35.000 --> 03:30:37.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:37.000 --> 03:30:39.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:41.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:41.000 --> 03:30:43.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:43.000 --> 03:30:45.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:45.000 --> 03:30:47.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:47.000 --> 03:30:49.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:49.000 --> 03:30:51.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:51.000 --> 03:30:53.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.

[03:30:55.000 --> 03:30:57.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:57.000 --> 03:30:59.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:30:59.000 --> 03:31:01.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:31:01.000 --> 03:31:03.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:31:03.000 --> 03:31:05.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:07.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
[03:31:07.000 --> 03:31:09.000]   I don't have a report in front of me.
