Based on the contract pricing and evaluations, staff believes that the utilization of Bid No. 21-32 and awarded contract to Vista
Paint Corporation and The Sherwin-Williams Company for the purchase of Paint, Related Materials, and Supplies, on an asneeded basis, is in the best interest of the District.

DESCRIPTION:Public Contract Code Section 10298 allows the State to consolidate the needs of multiple state agencies for
goods, information technology, and services and to establish contracts, master agreements, multiple award schedules,
cooperative agreements, including agreements with entities outside the state, and other types of agreements that leverage the
states buying power. Local agencies may contract with suppliers awarded those contracts without further competitive bidding
upon the same terms and conditions agreed to by the State.

support for approved ESSER III projects, and other projects that are not related to the Measure S program in an amount not to
exceed $150,000.At the November 17, 2022 board meeting, the Board again approved Colbi to continue providing facility-related
services to the District for the 2023 calendar year. At that time, the District did not request any additional funding as the District

additional use ofColbi for financial services support,in light of multiple vacancies in the fiscal department. Again the District did
not seek additional funding.

facilities and fiscal services support, and is seeking to add $125,000 to the contract for that time period. Colbi will continue to

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Individual school districts are responsible to provide their respective county superintendent of schools with
evidence of legal and appropriate assignments for all certificated employees. Legal and appropriate assignments for certificated
employees are those based upon the authorizations(s) contained on the specific certificate(s) held by the certificated employee,
as well as additional assignments which are authorized "assignment options" by the Education Code.
Most of the assignment options provided by the Education Code allow a teacher to serve in an additional assignment, provided
that the teacher has received a specified level of training relative to the subject area to be taught, that the teacher consents to
the assignment, and that the local governing board takes action on the assignment. These assignment options are typically
employed in middle schools and high schools where the teacher is assigned to instruct groups of students in a specific subject
matter area or areas.
The teachers/assignments listed on the Teacher Assignment/Consent Report reflect legal and appropriate assignments based
upon authorized assignment options in the Education Code where the teacher has met all requirements and has consented to
the assignment.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover
assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.
The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.
FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact on the district.

with Santiago Middle School

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: The District is the chartering authority for Santiago Middle School (Santiago), and the District most recently took
action to renew Santiagos Charter effective July 1, 2020. Santiagos Charter term has been extended by operation of law through
and including June 30, 2028. In addition to the Charter, there is a separate Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and
addendum which serve to clarify the relationship between Santiago and the District relative to the operation of Santiago.
As part of the Districts ongoing monitoring and oversight of Santiago, the District works with Santiago to periodically review and
update the MOU to ensure that it accurately and fully addresses the respective fiscal, operational, and administrative
responsibilities, the relationship between Santiago and the District, and other matters not otherwise addressed or resolved by the
terms of the Santiago Charter.
An updated MOU has been collaboratively prepared by District and Santiago staff, including legal counsel, for consideration by
the Board of Education. The proposed MOU was approved by the Santiago Charter Board at its June 28, 2023 meeting,
contingent upon approval by the Board of Education, and a copy of the proposed MOU has been provided to the Board of
Education for individual review.
This MOU includes updates and revisions to reflect operations and best practices, and it replaces and supersedes the
memorandum of understanding and addendum that are currently in place between the parties. Updates from the current
memorandum of understanding include revisions consistent with changes to the law, clarifications regarding serving students
with disabilities, and updated insurance provisions. The MOU term will be coextensive with the Charter term and will continue in
full force and effect during any renewal unless and until such time as it is replaced or the parties agree to terminate the MOU.

DESCRIPTION:The new course outlines described below have been reviewed by the Central County Career Technical
Partnership (CTEp) for CTE courses and the Districts Curriculum Department for all other courses. These courses are
recommended to the Board of Education for approval.

AP PRECALCULUS
AP Precalculus centers on functions modeling dynamic phenomena. This research-based exploration of functions is designed to
better prepare students for college-level calculus and provide grounding for other mathematics and science courses. In this
course, students study a broad spectrum of function types that are foundational for careers in mathematics, physics, biology,
health science, business, social science, and data science. Throughout this course, students develop and hone symbolic
manipulation skills, including solving equations and manipulating expressions, for the many function types throughout the course.
Students also learn that functions and their compositions, inverses, and transformations are understood through graphical,
numerical, analytical, and verbal representations, which reveal different attributes of the functions and are useful for solving
problems in mathematical and applied contexts. In turn, the skills learned in this course are widely applicable to situations that
involve quantitative reasoning.
This course meets the UC C requirement.
FOUNDATIONS DIGITAL AUDIO PRODUCTION: THE ART OF SOUND I
Foundations Digital Audio Production: The Art of Sound I is a Career Technical Education Course (CTE) that focuses on the use
of entry level software for basic audio engineering. Students are given projects that allow them to design and complete artistically

viable musical files. Through projects and research, students will experience different aspects of digital media arts. They will
learn to critique music and watch for trends and patterns. Students will learn to identify and create specific genres of music and
apply this knowledge to audio engineering.
This course meets the UC F requirement.
INTERMEDIATE DIGITAL AUDIO: THE ART OF SOUND II
Intermediate Digital Audio: The Art of Sound is a Career Technical Education Course (CTE) that will expand students knowledge
of audio engineering and production. This course places a strong emphasis on building skills of collaboration, which are key to
those in the music industry. Students will become familiar with digital audio workstations (DAWs), and begin working in ProTools,
software that is the industry standard for audio engineers working in the film, broadcast, music, and video game industries.
Students will proficiently use DAWs to create a variety of digital audio projects, learn basic elements of sound design, audio &
video synchronization, sequencing, editing, recording and mixing. Additionally, students will be introduced to the various careers
available in the audio production industry, the skills needed for these careers, and pathways to attaining these skills.
This course meets the UC F requirement.
SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA HONORS
Symphony Orchestra Honors is an advanced ensemble composed of string, wind and percussion musicians selectively chosen
from a rigorous audition process. This course is designed to prepare instrumental music students for the elements of music they
will encounter at the collegiate level. Areas of study include entrance auditions, proficiency exams for placement in music theory,
music history, and/or aural skills classes, and admittance into a collegiate music program. Areas of topical study include aural
skills, sight-singing, music theory, critical listening, instrumental pedagogy/technique, and music history. Through the study and
performance of quality repertoire, students will examine a wealth of orchestral works from multiple styles and genres,
encompassing all musical time periods from the Renaissance to the 21st century, with a heavy emphasis on contemporary
music. Students enrolled in this class will learn how to realize the complex technical and artistic demands of a piece of orchestral
literature by addressing musical components such as balance, blend, phrasing, expression, texture, intonation, dynamics,
interpretation, and style.
This course meets the UC F requirement.
FINANCIAL LITERACY (APEX)
Financial Literacyoffers an engaging, scaffolded curriculum that introduces key topics and principles necessary to financial
literacy. The one-semester course covers earning and spending; savings and investing; credit and debt; protection of assets; and
financial planning and decision-making. Through real-life scenarios and hands-on activities, the course explores choosing among
banking and investment options, shopping for an auto loan, choosing among career and college options, financing options for
continuing education, planning for retirement, and creating and living within a budget. Financial Literacy is designed to
complement courses in Economics and Mathematics for Personal Finance.
This course meets the UC G requirement.
FINANCIAL ALGEBRA (APEX)
Financial Algebra focuses on real-world financial literacy, personal finance, and business subjects. Students apply what they
learned in Math I and Math II to topics including personal income, taxes, checking and savings accounts, credit, loans and
payments, car leasing and purchasing, home mortgages, stocks, insurance, and retirement planning. Students then extend their
investigations using more advanced mathematics, such as systems of equations (when studying cost and profit issues) and
exponential functions (when calculating interest problems).
This course meets the UC C requirement.

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education adopt
Resolution No. 01-23-24 granting signature authorization
for specific District administrative/leadership employes as
indicated on the attached document.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Authorization of signatures is an item that is routinely updated to reflect changes in personnel and to comply with
the requirements of the California Education Code.
As the agency which ultimately releases District payrolls and warrants, the Orange County Department of Education (OCDE)
must maintain on file the approved signature authorizations for all school districts. The signatures are applicable to various
documents which are approved by the Board of Education and in compliance with the Education Code and other pertinent state
and federal laws. The administrative/leadership employees for whom the signature authorizations are designated do not transfer
that authority to any staff members.
Purchase orders are processed within the limitations of existing site/program budgets, with the P.O. listing submitted to the
Board at each meeting. Non-routine expenditures for consultants, contracts, major facility additions, etc. are submitted to the
Board separately for authorization. Before the preparation of a warrant, it is determined that the proper authorization and
approvals exist. Warrants prepared by the District are forwarded to the OCDE for review of documentation, signature, and entry
to OUSDs county ledgers before they are returned to the District for release to vendors, consultants, or contractors. Purchase
orders, bid documents, warrants, payroll, federal/state/county documents, etc. are audited by the Districts independent audit firm.
FISCAL IMPACT:This item has no fiscal impact on the district.
