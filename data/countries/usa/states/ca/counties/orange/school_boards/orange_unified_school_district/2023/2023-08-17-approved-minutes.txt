backpacks for Orange Unified students this year through the Friendly Center. Trustee Erickson congratulated Mr. Gonzalez and
thanked him for stepping up in difficult times. She mentioned that a traditional search would have been preferred but that
process would not have yielded a better candidate at this time and that her voice would not have been heard. She noted that
Mr. Gonzalez proved over the years that he cares for Orange Unified, that his priority is to keep the district together, and that
she's looking forward to working with him.

days of school. She mentioned that there are challenges at the school sites with changes in principals and staff but that she
admires the resiliency of our educators as they work around those challenges and are always there for the students and their
parents.

recognition. She mentioned that staff have a First Amendment right to voice their opinions after hours.
5. APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Action: A. Approval of minutes from the July 24, 2023 meeting
Trustee Erickson informed the board that the following statement should be added to item 7A, Explore Academy: the board

agreement was in lieu of Prop 39 and Explore waived its Prop 39 rights for the 24-25 school year. Olive Crest paid $16,000 per
month for their license, Explore Academy would be charged 84,000 for school year 24-25.

meeting with additional amendments.
6. PUBLIC COMMENT
Procedural: A. Guidelines: Members of the audience may address the Board of Education on agenda items during
consideration of that item. Speaking time is limited to three (3) minutes per speaker with a maximum of twenty (20) minutes
per topic. Persons wishing to speak should submit a Public Comment card prior to the meeting. Public Comments on nonagenda items that are within the Board's subject matter jurisdiction will occur after consideration of Action items,
Information/Discussion items and Consent items.
7. ACTION ITEMS
Action: A. PROPOSED REVISIONS TO BOARD POLICIES AND BYLAWS SECOND READING AND APPROVAL
Superintendent Gonzalez introduced the item.
There was a discussion on BB 9323 Meeting Conduct. Trustee Erickson added the following suggestion:
The total time for agenda items, and non-agenda items at regular meetings, shall be thirty (30) minutes. When more than 30
individuals have presented requests to speak, the time allowed to the first 30 who made requests will be as follows:
A. 1-10
B. 1-15
C. 1-30
The number of speakers as to any agenda or non-agenda item will be determined just prior to the time that item is

considered, and speakers must be present to be counted in the total. Trustee Yamasaki mentioned that the policy currently
reads that if there are more than 30 speakers, we move the rest to the end of the agenda but she would like to hear speakers
before the agenda item. Trustee Rusmey suggested having 30 minutes as default but if there are more than 30 speakers to
come up with a board consensus. She asked staff to rewrite the policy to include the suggested changes and bring it back to
the next meeting.
Trustee Ortega suggested moving item 4C, Board Recognition of Students, Staff, and Community to the end of the agenda to
be able to start the meeting immediately and conduct business right away. Trustee Erickson objected. She stated that this is
the fun part of the meeting and should remain at the beginning. Trustee Yamasaki suggested keeping it where it is on the
agenda but adding a time limit. Superintendent Gonzalez mentioned that BB 9323.1 is about the order of the agenda and
should be discussed at another meeting. There was a discussion about a time limit for Board Recognition of Students, Staff,
and community. Trustee Erickson mentioned that it is important for the public to hear what the board members have learned
and seen on the ground while visiting campuses, get their perspective, and hear all about what's happening in the district. She
stated that this is an important part of the agenda. Mr. Ledesma suggested a time limit of three minutes for the trustees to
speak. Since this was the first time this was introduced, Trustee Ledesma asked the board members to reflect on the time
limits and give suggestions to the Superintendent.
It is recommended that the Board of Education receive the proposed Board Policy revision for a second reading and approval
except for BB9320, Meetings, and Notices.

The board members discussed the board policy. Trustee Miner stated that this policy is legal and that The US Supreme Court
has never ruled in favor of a child's privacy rights over a parent's right to be informed about their child's safety and health at
school. She noted that this is a vital piece of conversation as it is about parent's rights and it protects children. Trustee
Erickson mentioned that we already have everything in this policy in place in Board Policies and Administrative Regulations and
that the only thing new in this policy is the outing of transgender and non-binary students. Ms. Erickson is concerned about
the discrimination of those students, the high likelihood of expensive litigation, and the blatant government interference in the
family unit. She stated that it is discriminatory to deny protection and rights to only certain students and that teachers should
not be put in this position. Trustee Yamasaki agreed with Trustee Erickson. She stated that board members typically don't
write entire policies as this is usually done by the superintendent. She claimed that this policy is politically motivated and that
we should not have a policy that is so restrictive that it doesn't take individual circumstances into account. She noted that in
an ideal situation, parents and children have that discussion but that is not always reality. She stated that she opposed this
policy. Trustee Page thanked the speakers for sharing their personal stories. She noted that we need to create a safe learning
environment for all students, not just for some students as this is creating a dangerous environment for part of our students.
She mentioned that we have a teacher shortage and as teachers will not out their students as this is a process without a
timeline, and this policy might add to that shortage. Ms. Page mentioned that we need to offer these students counseling and
a safe space.
At 10:00 pm there was a vote to extend the meeting until 1:00 am.
Motion by Angie Rumsey, second by Rick Ledesma.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Andrea Yamasaki, Kris Erickson, Ana Page, Rick Ledesma, John Ortega, Angie Rumsey, Madison Miner
Trustee Ortega thanked the audience for coming out tonight and expressing their voices. He mentioned that the context of
parents needs to be looked at and make sure they are truly supported 100% as we need to notify them about books in the
library, and curriculum. He stated that this is all about being honest and that he is in favor of parental consent and
notification. He noted that everything in the policy is stipulated by law and he will fight to protect the students.
Trustee Rumsey asked Superintendent Gonzalez and legal counsel what happened to teachers who do not report this and what
would the repercussions be once this policy is passed. She stated that foundationally she supports parents and wants parents
to be involved in their kids' education but she's also concerned. Superintendent Gonzalez mentioned that it's hard to give
concrete answers to hypothetical questions but that staff is currently trying to work through the policy to better understand it
and what the impact would have on students, staff, and families. Trustee Ledesma asked Trustee Rumsey to provide
suggestions and share them with the board since this is still a first reading. Trustee Rumsey mentioned that she would be
more in favor of the teacher informing the principal or school counselor, as the school counselor has more training in this area.
She noted that she also doesn't want to take rights away from parents and that this is a complicated issue.
Board president Ledesma ended the discussion by stating that this is a battle of perspectives. He noted that this is either
about the privacy of the students or the safety of the students. He mentioned that parents are not criminals and that children
are not owned by the state.
After a 10-minute break, the meeting reconvened at 10:55 pm

Procedural: A. Non-Agenda Items: Members of the audience may address the Board of Education on non-agenda items that
are within the Board's subject matter jurisdiction. Speaking time is limited to three (3) minutes per speaker with a maximum
of twenty (20) minutes per topic. Persons wishing to speak should submit a Public Comment card prior to the meeting. Nonagenda items may neither be acted upon nor discussed by the Board but will be responded to either by telephone, mail, or at
a subsequent meeting.
Public comments:
Jolin Lang, OUSD parent: Don't wait 3 days to notify me when my kid is injured. The language in the policy is wrong. The
teacher will tell the kids to tell their parents. That's what teachers are doing most of the time. Most parents are great.
Florita, OUSD parent: Pamphlet given to students at El Modena High School that was created by Planned Parenthood. End this
program for the purpose of protecting the district from lawsuits.
Lori Keeler: Lies are told by the recall effort. The board majority does not create chaos. Public education should be about
educating all students.
Patty: Thanked the board for putting out a resolution. There is nothing worse than a child keeping secrets from their parents.
Nicolette Vonchelle: Dangerous bills are being turned into laws that take away parental oversight. Children can be removed
from their homes without any investigation.
Chrystal Tousignant, OUSD parent: Board meetings should be boring. Why do you feel the need to stir the pot? The dais hould
not be used as a political culprit. You are not listening to us. You make OUSD the laughing stock. We can't attract and retain in
this chaos.
Rosa: Only family members will protect children as her own family did.
