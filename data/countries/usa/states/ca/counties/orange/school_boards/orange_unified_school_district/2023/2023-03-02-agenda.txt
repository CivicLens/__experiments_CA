Management District (SCAQMD) to replace compressed natural gas (CNG) compressors and fueling stations. The original

On December 6, 2022, the State of California awarded California Multiple Award Schedule (CMAS) Contract Number 4-22-121015 (Contract) for the purchase of Playworld Systems playground equipment to Dave Bang, which is effective through

volume pricing would be better than the District could obtain on its own for the Districts as-needed purchases.

DESCRIPTION: At the April 14, 2022 board meeting, the Board of Education approved Resolution No. 31-21-22 which
authorized contracts with the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Carl Moyer Program Year 22 (grant
funding of $910,084) for Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Infrastructure Expansion and Upgrade. This grant funding was
awarded to expand and upgrade our existing CNG infrastructure, e.g., compressors, nozzles, hoses, etc., in an effort to continue
to grow our CNG fleet to better serve the needs of our students. The contract states the District will need to meet an estimated
annual CNG usage. In order to meet that requirement, the District is encouraged to expand the school bus fleet with additional
CNG school buses to avoid any contract violations with SCAQMD.

District Staff recommends purchasing eight (8) 2024 Thomas Saf-T-Liner HDX 48 Passenger Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)
school buses which would be used for transporting students to and from long distance events, such as science camp, sporting
events, field trips, and home-to-school routes, if needed. These buses will be equivalent to charter style motor coach buses with
high-end amenities, i.e., MCC roof-top ducted A/C system, parcel racks for luggage (interior), LED reading lights, individual
passenger USB ports, pass-through luggage compartments (exterior), and bucket seating/charter-style seating.
