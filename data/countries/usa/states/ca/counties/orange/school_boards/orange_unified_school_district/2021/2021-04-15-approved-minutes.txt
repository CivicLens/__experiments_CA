teachers are doing a fabulous job of teaching those in the classroom and those online as well. She said, it is no easy
task, they are serving our students as good as can be during these unusual times. We are all doing the best we can
and thank you to all the staff that have been working so hard to continue the education of our students.
Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Board Clerk, Kris Erickson recognized staff for putting on an incredible vaccination clinic; it was a huge priority for
Orange Unified to get vaccinations for all those that wanted one. The event was extremely well run and well organized.
Also, Kris shared that she participated in a meeting for the Title VI Native American program and noted that Orange
USD continues to participate in the Title VI Federal Grant Program. She thanked Oryden Gould and Sandy Schaffer for
all their work with the Title VI program in Orange USD, as it provides tutoring for students and support for our Native
American students.
Andrea Yamasaki shared she is the vice president of the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association
(APISBMA) and recently participated in a meeting where members were asked to share how their districts are planning
for summer learning. Andrea asked Assistant Superintendent of Ed Services, Cathleen Corella to provide information
on the summer learning plan, to share with the APISBMA committee. Andrea said that what she provided
was much more than expected, instead of a few pages, it was a book. Orange USD's summer learning plan so
impressed the committee, that California SBA reached out to Orange Unified for more information. Andrea commended
Ms Corella for the great job that she does for Orange Unified students. Orange Unified is so far ahead of many
California schools and some schools in the State are just now going back into the class.
Board member Ana Page said prior to Spring Break, she had the pleasure of visiting the Early Learning Center and
complemented them on the diaper and food event to offer needy families food and diapers. She said it was a huge
success and benefited many of our needy families. Ms. Page cited the recent shooting in North Orange, in the area of
Fletcher Elementary and thanked Fletcher Elementary Principal, Mrs. Sara Pelly, for stepping up and having a mental
health counselor on hand for students that were in need. Ms. Page recently accompanied Asst. Superintendent
Cathleen Corella on site visits to several high schools where she visited Career Technical Education
(CTE) classrooms. She was impressed with the CTE programs, currently at the high schools. She especially liked the
CTE Certification component and mentioned that the programs are amazing. High school students are able to do what
college students are currently doing while in college, which is a big advantage and Orange Unified students will be wellprepared as they graduate.
Information: D. State of the School Report - Canyon High School - Rushil Shah presenting
Student Board Member Rushil Shah presented for Canyon High School. He spoke about the importance of student
engagement and Canyon HS Club Carnival. Clubs help students stay connected, and give back to the community.
