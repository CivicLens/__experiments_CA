4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: As part of the Measure S Bond Program, the District must complete a process through the County and State, in
accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act, when completing new projects that may affect our school campus
environments and the communities surrounding them.
Project Description (El Modena HS- Measure S Phase II):
Construction of two (2) 2-Story Modular Classroom Buildings. Two (2) new connecting aerial walkways and (2) new elevators,
modernization of existing Building 800, expansion of the existing Administration Building, modernization of existing General
Classrooms in Buildings 200, 300, 400 and 50 and site improvements including new asphalt and concrete paving, curbs, gutters,
Landscaping, Security gates and fencing, Site furnishings, signage site lighting and underground utilities.
California Environmental Quality Act Compliance:
Projects undertaken by public agencies are subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) as outlined in Public
Resources Code (PRC) Section 21000 et seq. and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code Regulations, Title 14, Section
15000 et seq.). PRC section 21065 defines a project as follows:
Project means an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably
foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment
The proposed modernization improvements at El Modena High School are a Project under CEQA. Staff has evaluated the
Project in whole and has determined that the proposed improvements are categorically exempt from further environmental
review and the provisions of CEQA under CEQA GuidelinesSection 15314. Minor Additions to Schools, which states:
Class 14 consists of minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not
increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less. The addition of portable
classrooms is included in this exemption.

Staff, along with guidance from our CEQA consultant Environmental Audit, has determined that the Project is not subject to any
exceptions to the categorical exemption (CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2). Therefore, the District may file a Notice of
Exemption (NOE) for the Project, which exempts the Project from further environmental review and the provisions of CEQA.
Current Considerations
Adoption of Resolution 34-21-22 which provides the required acknowledgements and findings with respect to the Project at El
Modena High School to enable the District to:

1. Find the Proposed Project Exempt from CEQA
2. Approve the Filing and Recordation of a NOE
3. Approve the Project, and
4. Authorize staff to file the NOE for the Project with the appropriate public agencies.
Upon approval, the Notice of Exemption will be filed with the County Clerk and the State Office of Planning and Research (OPR).
The filing of a Notice of Exemption with the County Clerk starts a 35-day statute of limitations period on legal challenges to the
agency's decision that the project is exempt from CEQA.

levels and central office administrators on the Council. The DCC is an advisory council which addresses universal and specific
issues that either directly or indirectly impact the curriculums offered in the Orange USD schools. The Council will make
recommendations to the Superintendent and Board of Education after thoroughly researching and discussing each issue and
potential impact on student achievement. Texts for CTE courses are previously approved by the Central County ROP/Career
Technical Education Partnership (CTEp).
