box theater, and a dance studio; completely modernize the quad area; and add two new connecting aerial walkways and two

attractive classrooms and facilities for students and faculty.
The District held mandatory pre-bid job walks at El Modena High School for interested contractors to walk-through, inspect, and
ask questions. The District required that interested contractors meet stringent prequalification requirements to help ensure that a
high-quality project would be completed within the required time. Of the contractors who attended the job walk and were
prequalified, seven prime contractors obtained bid documents, and two of them submitted bids. The District opened those bids

DESCRIPTION: There are limited avenues for school districts to receive external facility funding. Historically, school districts
have relied upon a combination of locally authorized general obligation bonds, state bonds, and local resources, such as
developer fees or proceeds from the sale of surplus property, to modernize or construct new facilities.
The priority funding process for State Facility Program (SFP) funds has been created to allow improvement projects to receive
apportionment with accelerated timelines. The District has fully funded the following projects with Measure S general obligation
proceeds and/or local reserves. The District has submitted the following funding applications for State Matching Funds from the
State Facility Program (SFP).

To comply with SFP Guidelines, the District is required to engage an external auditor to ensure matching funds have been
appropriately committed. The District wishes to engage the Nigro & Nigro accountancy firm to perform the program audits. The
audit for each project will range from $5,000 to $6,500 with a total cost, not to exceed $40,000. The audit work will be conducted
after the receipt of funds. The anticipated completion date is June 30, 2024.

DESCRIPTION: Periodically, District sites and programs assess equipment, vehicles, materials, and other District items that are
obsolete, beyond economical repair, are no longer required within the current curriculum, or cannot be used for any other school
purpose. All items in these categories determined to be in suitable condition are reused within District operations.
Education Code Section 17545 et. seq. and Board Policy 3270(a) provide for the sale of District items. Surplus items are usually
dispositioned by public sale, or, if no reasonable bids are received, by private sale for salvage. Each item is subject to
reallocation within the District prior to sale or disposal.
At the May 6, 2021 board meeting, the Board of Education approved Resolution No. 22-20-21 which authorized the District to
participate in funding opportunities for new electric vehicle ("EV") school buses through the South Coast Air Quality Management
District (SCAQMD) and the Hybrid Vehicle Incentive Project (HVIP). As part of the SCAQMD award, the District would be
required to "crush and dismantle" two older diesel-powered school buses within 60 days of receiving the funding. The District
was awarded two EV school buses, receiving $400,000 per bus.

At the February 3, 2022 board meeting, the Board of Education approved the purchase of two EV school buses awarded by
SCAQMD and HVIP grant funding. The District is now required to "crush" and "dismantle" two older diesel powered school
buses. The District seeks the Board's authorization to declare the following two buses to be surplus property and to dispose of
them as required bySCAQMD Grant Agreement #G22230.

DESCRIPTION:The California Colleges Guidance Initiative (CCGI) provides students with in-depth, grade-appropriate
information and data-driven tools to support college, career, and financial aid planning and applications. CCGI uses
CaliforniaColleges.edu which is the State of Californias official college and career planning platform. Lessons and tools help
students discover goals for life after high school, make plans to achieve them, and launch their futures. This platform is free for
California 6th - 12th grade students, their parents, and educators. Counselors and educators can access a comprehensive suite
of reporting tools that automate routine tasks and help quickly identify students who need more assistance with college and
career planning. OUSD recently attained the K16 Regional Collaborative Grant which requires that each K-12 LEA who is a
recipient have an MOU in place with CCGI. The OUSD counselors plan to use CCGI to help with presentations to students on
FAFSA, and opportunities for college and career post-secondary success. The tools and resources available on CCGI will help
students with college and career planning.
