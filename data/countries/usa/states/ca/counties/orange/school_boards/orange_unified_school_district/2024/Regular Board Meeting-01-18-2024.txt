Recommended Action :

The Board President recommends that the Board of
Education take action to approve the proposed First
Amended and Restated in lieu of Proposition 39 Facilities
Use Agreement ("First Amended Agreement") by and among
Orange Unified School District, Orange County Classical
Academy Countywide Benefit Charter School, and Orange
County Classical Academy.

Public Content
Description: In December 2023, the District received a request from the Orange County Classical Academy Countywide Benefit
Charter School and Orange County Classical Academy (Charter School) to consider providing a portion of the former Peralta
school site for Charter School use. (See Exhibit B to the First Amended Agreement). During December and January,

negotiations have taken place between representatives of OCCA and District staff to replace the Original in-lieu of Proposition 39
Facilities Use Agreement. Attached hereto is the latest version of the proposed First Amended Agreement, as proposed and
provided by the Charter School.

The proposed First Amended Agreement will fully and completely satisfy any and all obligations of the District to the Charter
School pursuant to Education Code section 47614 and its implicating regulations, commonly referred to as "Proposition 39", for
the period covered by the First Amended Agreement. The current in lieu of Proposition 39 Agreement with the Charter School is
through June 30, 2027. If approved by the parties, the District shall not be obligated to make any payment to or provide any
additional facilities to the Charter School for the term of the First Amended Agreement. The initial term will be through June 30,
2027, and provides for automatic renewal by the Charter School upon renewal of the Charter Schools Charter by the Orange
County Board of Education, ending no later than June 30, 2049. The Charter School may terminate the First Amended
Agreement at its discretion within the first one hundred eighty (180) days. Thereafter the Charter School may terminate the First
Amended Agreement on or before January 1 each fiscal year, effective on the following June 30, or may terminate between
January 2 and June 30, effective on the second June 30 following notice to the District.
The proposed First Amended Agreement provides that the Charter School shall initially pay the District $22,916.67 per month for
ground space identified on Exhibit B and $1,375.00 per month for the existing gym facility. For the period from July 1, 2025,
through June 30, 2026, the Charter School shall pay the District an annual base rate of $275,000, plus an increase per the State
of California Public-School COLA adjustment. The annual fee will be increased by the COLA adjustment every fiscal year
throughout the term of the First Amended Agreement.
Improvements on the site such as portable classrooms will require District consent and approval by the Division of the State
Architect or public agency having jurisdiction over site improvements. District consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The
Charter School shall maintain insurance as specified in the First Amended Agreement.
The proposed First Amended Agreement includes a right of first refusal for the Charter School to take over other portions of the
Peralta site whose license agreement expires or is otherwise vacated during the term of the First Amended Agreement. The
Charter School will pay the District for any such additional space at the same price per square foot that it is paying for the space
initially covered by the First Amended Agreement.
The proposed First Amended Agreement recognizes the Charter School will seek financing for its improvements to the facilities.
The First Amended Agreement will allow the Charter School to grant the lender the ability to cure any of the Charter Schools
defaults and put another charter school, non-profit private-school or other non-profit entity offering educational services as tenant
in the property to pay rent to the District and comply with all other obligations under the First Amended Agreement or remove the
portables as collateral if the Charter School defaults.
FISCAL IMPACT: As per the terms of the proposed First Amended Agreement.

DESCRIPTION:The accountancy firm of Nigro & Nigrowill present information from the 2022-23 audit report. The Education
Code requires that the independent audit be submitted to the State Controllers Office, federal agencies, and the Orange County
Department of Education. The State Controllers Office reviews each independent audit and approves or disapproves the audit
report within three to four months of receipt. The independent audit report for 2022-23 was filed with the state by December 15,
2023.
The general objectives of an audit are to determine whether: (1) the districts financial statements are presented fairly in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (2) there is effective district control over and proper accounting for
revenues, expenditures, assets, and liabilities; (3) state and federal reports and claims for advances or reimbursements contain
accurate and reliable financial data and are presented in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements; and (4) state and
federal funds are being expended in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements and those provisions of law or
regulations that could have a material effect on the financial statements and or on the awards that were tested.
The independent audit of the 2022-23 District fiscal records indicates a positive financial status and ongoing maintenance and
improvement of appropriate internal controls. The ending balances for all funds have been verified to be those previously stated
in the Districts Standardized Account Code Structure (SACS) Financial Reporting documents on file with the California
Department of Education and those indicated in the independent accounting system of the Orange County Department of
Education, which maintains ledgers on all payroll, warrant, and financial transactions of any sort of each school district located
within Orange County.
