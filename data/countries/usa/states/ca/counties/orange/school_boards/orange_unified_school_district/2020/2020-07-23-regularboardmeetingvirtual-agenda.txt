Staff recommends that the Board adopt the attached
RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE
ORANGE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT RECONFIRMING
ACCEPTANCE OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE
RECOMMENDATION; DECLARING PROPERTY SURPLUS;
DECLARING INTENTION TO OFFER THE PROPERTY FOR
LEASE; AND AUTHORIZING REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF
COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCEDURES UNDER
EDUCATION CODE SECTION 17466 ET SEQ.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The Districts Board previously declared approximately 19.57 acres of real property located at 2190 N. Canal
Street, Orange, CA 92865 known generally as the Peralta School Site (Property) surplus property pursuant to the Education
Code section 17455 et seq. Based on the Boards previous finding that the Property is surplus, the District entered into a lease
agreement for the Property pursuant to California law, which expired on March 31, 2015. After exploring several options, District
staff believes it can pursue a long term ground lease or leases of the Property to maximize potential value for the District. District
staff is aware no factual circumstances that would render the acceptance of the Advisory Committees previous recommendation
and comments with respect to the Property moot. Because the Property continues to be considered surplus, the District may
pursue a lease of the Property as set forth in the prior resolution adopted by the Board and in accordance with the process of the
Education Code.
For school district surplus property, Education Code sections 17455 et seq. establishes a bid auction procedure whereby school
districts must conduct a public auction and award the lease to the highest bidder (the Traditional Lease Procedure). The District
has determined that the Traditional Lease Procedure will not allow the District to take advantage of the potential of the Property
and desires to solicit proposals through a Request for Proposals for the lease of the Property.
Education Code section 33050 et seq. allows the governing board of a school district to request that the State Board of
Education waive all or part of any section of the Education Code or any regulation adopted by the State Board of Education that
implements a provision of the Education Code. Thus, the District seeks to obtain a waiver to waive the Traditional Lease
Procedure and allow the District to lease this Property without having to follow the Traditional Lease Procedure.
FISCAL IMPACT: Fiscal impact to be determined.
