4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Government Code Sections 66001 and 66006 require local agencies, including school districts, to report
ondeveloper fees that are collected and expended on both an annual and five-year basis.
The annual report focuses on the amount of developer fees collected by theDistrict and expended throughout the fiscal year. The
five-year report requires a more detailed analysis of the Districts overall use of developer fees. It is more efficientfor a school
districtto prepare a comprehensive report each fiscal year that includes both the annual and five-year collection and expenditure
information. By combining these two reports, there is securityagainst apotential penalty of refunding unexpended developer fees
for failure to timely report expenditures in the appropriate year.
Although not required by a resolution, the report findings are often made in the form of a resolution that is adopted by the
governing board to facilitate compliance with the requisite codes and regulations.

The annual report must be made within 180 days from the last day of the fiscal year. The five-year findings must be presented
for approval by the Governing Board in conjunction with an annual report. The completed reports and applicable findings must be
available for public review at least 15 days prior to approval by the governing board.

DESCRIPTION:The Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief plan (ESSER III), approved by the Board of Education
on October 21, 2021, specified the need for suitable display technology visible from all angles and distances in the classroom.
The Informational Technology Department has identified 707 classrooms with degrading or no display technology. The

level of display technology.

established, vetted OUSD vendor who the District trusts. The District recommends utilizing EKC Enterprises, Inc. (EKC) to
warehouse, asset tag, assemble, and deploy these 707 LCD monitor installations across all school campuses.
RECOMMENDATION: District staff recommendsthat the Board authorize the use of Resolution 14-21-22 to procure the services
of EKC Enterprises, Inc. (EKC) for the installation of mobile carts. If the board approves the use of Resolution 14-21-22, then an
agenda item will be prepared for EKC Enterprises, Inc. for the February 3, 2022 Meeting.

DESCRIPTION:The accountancy firm of Nigro & Nigrowill present information from the 2020-21 audit report. The Education
Code requires that the independent audit be submitted to the State Controllers Office, federal agencies, and the Orange County
Department of Education. The State Controllers Office reviews each independent audit and approves or disapproves the audit
report within three to four months of receipt. The independent audit report for 2020-21 will be filed with the state by January 31,
2022.

The general objectives of an audit are to determine whether: (1) the districts financial statements are presented fairly in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (2) there is effective district control over and proper accounting for
revenues, expenditures, assets, and liabilities; (3) state and federal reports and claims for advances or reimbursements contain
accurate and reliable financial data and are presented in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements; and (4) state and
federal funds are being expended in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements and those provisions of law or
regulations that could have a material effect on the financial statements and or on the awards that were tested.
The independent audit of the 2020-21 District fiscal records indicates a positive financial status and ongoing maintenance and
improvement of appropriate internal controls. The ending balances for all funds have been verified to be those previously stated
in the Districts Standardized Account Code Structure (SACS) Financial Reporting documents on file with the California

Department of Education and those indicated in the independent accounting system of the Orange County Department of
Education, which maintains ledgers on all payroll, warrant, and financial transactions of any sort of each school district located
within Orange County.
FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact.

Panel Assessment that was facilitated on Wednesday,
December 14, 2021, it was determined that a
recommendation for expulsion be presented to the Board of
Education. Parent and student have agreed to a Stipulated
Expulsion.
Education Code § 48915 states:
(a-1) Except as provided in subdivisions (c) and (e), the
principal or the superintendent of schools shall recommend
the expulsion of a pupil for any of the following acts
committed at school or at a school activity off school grounds,
unless the principal or superintendent determines that
expulsion should not be recommended under the
circumstances or that an alternative means of correction
would address the conduct:
(A) Causing serious physical injury to another person, except
in self-defense.
Education Code § 48900.5
Suspension shall be imposed only when other means of
correction fail to bring about proper conduct. However, a
pupil, including an individual with exceptional needs, as
defined in Section 56026, may be suspended for any of the
reasons enumerated in Section 48900 upon a first offense, if
the principal or superintendent of schools determines that the
pupil violated subdivision (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of Section
48900 or that the pupils presence causes a danger to
persons or property or threatens to disrupt the instructional
process.
It is recommended that the Board of Education uphold the
