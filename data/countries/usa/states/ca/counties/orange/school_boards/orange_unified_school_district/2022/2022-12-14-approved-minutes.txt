Trustee Yamasaki said it was an honor and privilege to serve as president. She thanked the staff, teachers, and Dr.
Hansen for their support. With a comprehensive health and safety plan in place, the district was able to open the schools
safely. Mrs. Yamasaki did over 100 site visits, events, and community-related meetings. She's very proud of the
accomplishments: opening an IB-approved school, installing solar panels in many schools, two science centers opened in
2022, procuring a fleet of electric buses, and the official opening of the El Modena pool. Orange Unified also added more
instructional assistants, counselors, and assistant principals, and started a committee for safe schools. She's grateful for
the many partnerships. Mrs. Yamasaki welcomed Mrs. Miner to the board and expressed her hope that Orange Unified can
continue its success next year and that the Board can work collaboratively towards putting the students' needs first.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report

Mrs. Moffat's heart is in the right place, and that she always placed the children first. He's looking forward to working with
the new board.
Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Trustee Erickson congratulated Chapman Hills Elementary on their STEM center opening. This was a partnership
between Orange Unified, Chapman University, the PTSA, and the Child Creativity Lab. Mrs. Erickson attended the
Cambridge Elementary TK-3 Holiday Celebration. She also participated in the distribution of gifts for a project called
"Warm Hands, Warm Heart". Staff provided jackets, shoes, and socks to Orange Unified's most vulnerable students. It
was very touching.
Trustee Page visited some school sites. She saw the preparation of the grand opening of the STEM center at Chapman
Hills. At Panorama Elementary the students were curious about what a Board does. She saw the kindergarteners at Taft
doing their Holiday program and joined the GRIP officer in a parent meeting. She participated in handing out gifts for the
"Warm Hand, Warm Heart"' program, and she's grateful for the donors that were able to donate to the students. Earlier
this month she attended the CSBA conference in San Diego. She attended workshops about student and family
engagements and connected with other trustees in Orange County. Mrs. Page welcomed Trustee Miner. She believes that
the board has many different perspectives which could be put to good use. Together the Board can start addressing
issues that it's facing.
Trustee Yamasaki attended Sycamore for the 'Warm Hands, Warm Hearth' project. She thanked the Student and
Community Services department for putting this together. Mrs. Yamasaki thanked Mr. Ledesma for his kind words for Mrs.
Moffat. Mrs. Yamasaki stated that Mrs. Moffat received a lot of recognition at her reception. Mrs. Moffat was an
exemplary board member for 22 years who dedicated her life to education and she will be missed.
Trustee Rumsey referred back to the last meeting where a public comment was made about Conscious Discipline
stating she was using fake websites to push her agenda. She wanted to clarify for the public that the website does have
the links and the videos she was referring to at the last meeting. She communicated with Dr. Hanse and Dr. Hansen
assured her that those websites were not part of the program for professional development. Mrs. Rumsey thanked Mrs.
Moffat. Her leadership helped Mrs. Rumsey as a new board member. She also congratulated Mrs. Miner.
Trustee Miner thanked Mrs. Moffat thank for her service. Mrs. Miner said she's looking forward to helping the kids in our
district. Mrs. Miner is happy to be here and grateful for all the support.
Trustee Erickson thanked the Orange Unified community for another four years. The previous years have been both
rewarding and challenging. One of the biggest accomplishments was finishing Phase I of Measure S and COVID brought a
lot of challenges. We must continue on our mission as a board to care for the whole child and to ensure that every
student gets the support that they need. We need to commit to working as a functional board and a healthy governance
team. The board needs to join together in a common cause to push this District forward.
Trustee Ortega stressed the importance of moving forward. The Board's job and objectives are for the students,
parents, and staff. The Board has gone through some challenges and Trustee Ortega hopes that we will progress forward
out of these challenges. He welcomed Trustee Miner and he's looking forward to the new year.
Student Board Member Madison Salloum from Canyon High School gave appreciation to the teachers. This week is a
very stressful week with finals and the end of the semester. She's excited about the first home basketball game. Madison
also wants to recognize the student sections of our schools. We currently have three high schools in the Top 10 in Orange
County.
Student Board Member Ruby Hewitt from El Modena High School talked about the first annual flee market that
supports sports clubs and other programs. Her ecological research club went on a field trip to the El Modena open space
to set up their research projects which was a part of the naturalist certification by the end of the year. It was a great way
to learn about our local ecosystem. She was also excited that the Dance Company has a new teacher and said she can't
wait for what's coming next. Varsity Cheer took first place in a recent competition. Ruby also mentioned the Wish Ferries
assembly with performances from Cheer, the Vanguard Dance Company, and the winter sports groups. The Wish Ferries
gave out gifts to students and staff for some spirit this holiday season.

Student Board Member Diego Paz thanked the people from the adult transition program and the panther buddies for
all the gifts. Orange High ASB has a similar program to "Warm Hands, Warm Hearts" that's called "Panther Wishes". The
program reaches out to the community and the students to see who is in need. ASB raised over $3500 for items to
donate to students. The items were distributed today. There is a lot of finals' stress but Panthers will push through.
Construction will start over winter break which will be an adjustment but the students are excited about the new
buildings. Diego also mentioned an incident that happened on campus that caused a soft lockdown. He said they need to
be prepared at all times that things can happen and that safety is the number one priority. The school handled it very
well. We made sure events like that don't define them and that they had a very successful assembly the next day. They
are proud of how they moved on and learned from it.
Student Board Member Hope Kimera from Villa Park High School mentioned that he's so proud of being number one
in the student section. ASB worked hard to accomplish that. Basketball started off with a win. The first winter formal
since 2019 is coming up and he's very excited. Hope also mentioned that Villa Park's ESports team is widely recognized
by the district and received a lot of sponsorship in the form of new computers.
Information: D. State of the School Report: Jay'da Douvia - Richland High School

welcoming environment for students to have the best chance at success. The majority of the students come from lessthan-optimal circumstances and need credits and support. The credit recovery program gives the students a chance to
redeem themselves and a second chance at success. Jay'da was able to recover her credits and is now graduating early.
A video was shown followed by a PowerPoint presentation highlighting various activities and events at Richland.
Richland Principal Lisa Ogan expressed her appreciation for Jay'da and recognized the students and staff that came
tonight. Mrs. Ogan introduced new Richland Student Board Member Jaida Lopez.
