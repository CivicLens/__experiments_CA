DESCRIPTION: At the May 6, 2021 board meeting, the Board of Education approved Resolution No. 22-20-21 which authorized
the District to submit an application and participate in the SCAQMD (South Coast Air Quality Management District) Lower
Emission School Bus Program 2021 and apply for additional HVIP (Hybrid Vehicle Incentive Program) funding. SCAQMD
provides grant funding for the purchase of new Type C and Type D Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and/or Zero Emission
school buses and HVIP provides funding for Zero Emission school buses.
The District was subsequently notified that its applications had been approved and at the February 3, 2022, board meeting, the
Board of Education approved the purchase of two electric vehicle (EV) school buses that were to be funded through SCAQMD
and HVIP grants, with a$30,612.48balance to be paid by the District.
HVIP has recently informed the District that additional grant funding in the amount of $210,000 per bus is available for six EV
school buses. This would cover approximately 50% of the cost per bus and result in a total award of $1,260,000 toward the
purchase of six EV school buses. The remaining balance of $1,231,837.44 would be the District's responsibility, which would be
covered by a financing contract that the District will present to the Board at the April Board meeting. This agenda item is to
approve the purchase of six EV vehicles and accept the grant award of $1,260,000.

California Department of General Services (DGS) is a cost-effective manner of procurement for products and services that is

DESCRIPTION:Ellevation Education is the English Learner student tracking information and instructional design software utilized
specifically for English Learners from Curriculum Associates, LLC. Ellevation allows districts to meet compliance requirements,

product is the usability to reclassify and track the progress and status of current English Learners and the reclassified English
Learner population. Reclassified students must be tracked for four years, which creates a large amount of paper communication.
Curriculum Associates, LLC software stores all the names of these students in their student database, and is able to send
teachers electronic forms to complete for the reclassification monitoring compliance.Ellevation syncs with the District's Aeries
system, so that student information is retrieved easily. Ellevation can also be coded to automatically reclassify students when
provided the requirements.

and student achievement instructional strategies. The term of this renewal is from April 2022 through March 2023.
