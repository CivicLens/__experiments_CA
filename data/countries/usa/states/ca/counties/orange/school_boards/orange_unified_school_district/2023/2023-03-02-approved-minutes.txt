evaluated, it's not focused on the students.
Darshan Smalaaden, OUSD parent: Mr. Ortega has a conflict of interest, he is a board member at Orca. Email also sent out an email to
promise a pool if voted for certain board members. Mr. Ortega should not be part of the discussion or the vote on the pool.
Nicole Jones, OUSD parent: Supports a 51-meter pool. LPA needs parameters. The pool does not need to move. An outdated plan should
not be used as part of the scope of the new plan. Stakeholder input is needed. Don't forget elementary and middle schools.
Based on direction from the Board on February 2, 2023, Staff recommends the services of LPA Architects to create a conceptual plan to
replace the pool at Villa Park High School with a 51-meter pool. LPA has submitted a proposal in the amount of $45,000 to create a
conceptual drawing, and map utility and facility upgrades that will be required to replace the pool and its related equipment. LPA will
utilize Cumming for the project estimate and present their plan and tentative construction budget at a future board meeting.
There was a discussion to amend the motion to include repairing the current pool or replacing the current pool with a 25-meter, 30-meter,
or 51-meter pool.
Motion to amend the original motion by Kris Erickson, second by Madison Miner

17. PUBLIC COMMENT NON-AGENDA ITEMS

Julie G, OUSD parent: Has concerns about Cerro Villa Middle School. Child doesn't feel comfortable at school. Has witnessed drug dealing
and vaping. Parent would like to see cameras and more discipline.
Tanya: applauds the removal of the SORA app. There are more books that are not appropriate. Wants a discussion on library books.
Kathy Moffat: enjoyed the presentation on the showcases and attract/retain. Reminded the board that this was implemented five years
ago. Thanks to those efforts we now see the successes. We must use the means that we can to help the students, parents, and families
to address this serious problem of student stress, anxiety and depression.
Sharon McAleer, OUSD parent: is invested in the district. The slideshow from the last board meeting is a slap in the face. We need
transparency. Don't badmouth our district.
Greg Goodlander: there are misrepresentations about the union, The union does not drive curriculum or sex education. These are
California State standards and laws. OUEA improves the working conditions of its members and the learning conditions of the students.
Lisa Shipman: appalled by the last board meeting. Don't yell at teachers, board members, and the union. We need kindness and respect
back in this world. Student behavior is out of control. We need discipline and we need the parent's help.
Allisa Kim: thank you Student Board Members and Board majority.
Eddie Kim: don't attack trustees in the parking lot and follow them home. Parents want to see better test scores and more college
readiness. Board Majority needs to work on it.
Lorrie Kaylor: against HPV Vaccine mandate bill. Government oversteps to mandate.
Patty Cabada: don't use this board for politics. Don't call parents extremists. It creates a hostile environment.
Abril Liu: Data is crucial. One graph tells you nothing. OUSD students are unique. Students are not created equal.
Rebecca Tippets, OUSD parent: Trustee Miner stated many falsities in her campaign. As a teacher, she never gave Trustee Miner's son a
teacher edition of a book on curriculum. Ms. Miner also stated falsy that the curriculum book contains sex ed. Ms. Miner sits on a bed of
lies.
Alex Brewsaugh, OUSD parent: on January 5th, the board received 53 comments on the termination of the Superintendent. Only one
comment was in favor. The Board majority committed a Brown Act violation and underestimated parents. They neglected requests to
hand over phone records and there is only 1 email. This board majority needs to be removed.
Brian Vea: CRT has no business in public education. He disagrees with California sex education. This curriculum is not good for the
students.
Tamera Rivera, OUSD parent: The data that was presented at the 2/23/23 board meeting was based on one test. We need more data. We
need to go back to pre-pandemic data. We need to see the big picture.
Catherine Sutherland, OUSD parent: Cares about test scores. Cares about students with learning disabilities. She wants to teach her
students to become better readers. She's fighting the turnover. Too many special education teachers come and go as well as
administration and it's exhausting.
Scott Resnick, OUSD parent: wants to hold the board accountable. It is a Brown Act violation to change the agenda in the middle of the
meeting. Give us the audit. Needs to be independent. The scope needs to be narrow and well-defined.
Erin Mejia: We need transparency. She asked Trustee Miner to be mindful of social media posts and accounts that she promotes and
shares and be more professional. AVID is not exploiting low-income students. Prioritize public comments from parents and taxpayers in
the district. Focus on education and don't listen to outsiders.
18. OTHER BUSINESS
