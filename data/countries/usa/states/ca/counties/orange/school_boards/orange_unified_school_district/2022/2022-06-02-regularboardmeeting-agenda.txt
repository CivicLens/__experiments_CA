Focus Area 4.1

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and the Local Control and Accountability Plan
(LCAP) regulations require that each districts LCAPapproval and adoptionbe held in a subsequent meeting and separate from
the Public Hearing on the LCAP (Education Code 52062 (b). In addition, the approval of the LCAP must be at the same meeting
as the approval and adoption of the District Budget pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), Section 42127. LEA's must
measure and report their progress regarding the local indicators for each state priority area, at the same meeting as the adoption
of the LCAP. Local indicatorswe must progress monitor are: Basic Services (1), Implementation of State Standards (2), Parent
Engagement (3), SchoolClimate (6), Access to Broad Course of Study (7).
The LCAP Public Hearing was held at the May 19thBoard of Education meeting to allow for public comment and
recommendations regarding the specific goals, actions and expenditures proposed in the LCAP and budget.The Board of
Education also received an information item on the LCAPin Weekly Board Updates.
The contents of the LCAP havebeen shared with the Superintendents District Advisory Council (DAC), District English Learner
Advisory Committee (DELAC), and various community partner meetings. The LCAP goals, services and actions were further
refined to include comments and recommendations from a multitude of focus group committees such as local School Site
Councils (SSC) and school district level committees that have provided feedback. This intensive community engagement
process began in October 2021 resulting in continuous improvement of the planthrough an analysis of student learning
outcomes, surveys, community partner meetings and consultation with the employee associations.
We are now in the second year of our three-year LCAP cycle. Goals and actions were reviewed and revised last year to align
with our current strategic plan, theEDGE:Excellence in Academics and Leadership;Dedicated and Engaged Communication;
Genuine Wellness and Safety; and Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital.
The development and adoption of theLCAPis the state-mandated strategic planning process for districts across the State of
California. Actions and services identifiedare directly aligned toLCFFfunding and will be under continual renewal through theLCAP
annual update process.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Education Code sections 42127 and 52062 require the school district governing board to adopt its budget at a
public meeting. This meeting shall be held after, but not on the same day as, the public meeting at which the governing board
holds the required public hearing. The public hearing of the proposed budget was held during the May 19, 2022, board meeting.
Average Daily Attendance:The 2022-23 Budget is constructed on the following student population:
ADA
OUSD

22,509.01

Non-Public Schools
29.64
Community Day School
6.47

1,024.01
Orange County Classical Academy
509.18
Sub Total (Charter Schools Only)
2,571.91
GRAND TOTAL
25,175.82
The total budgeted attendance of 22,545.12 (not including District charter schools, county special education, and county
community schools) reflects an anticipated decline of 355.96 in District ADA. District charter schools ADA of 2,571.91 reflects an
increase of 130 as compared to the prior year due to estimated grade span expansion for Orange County Classical Academy
and increased P-2 ADA for Santiago Charter Middle School.
Revenues:The following chart shows the driving factors of the LCFF in addition to ADA:
Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)

5.33%

3 Year Rolling Unduplicated English Learner (EL), Free/ Reduced (F/R) and Foster Youth (FY)
Student Percentage

47.37%

Until the state adopts its 2022-23 Budget, the proposed funded LCFF yields an estimated $896,602 net decrease compared to
the prior year. The reason for the decline in funding is attributed to the sunsetting of the hold harmless provisions. The applied
5.33% COLA does not completely cover the loss in funding from student enrollment decline.
Most state categorical entitlements and grants known to be ongoing are projected at current levels. Only special education
AB602 funding is expected to receive the 5.33% COLA. No increase is anticipated for ongoing federal programs in this adoption.
Interest earnings are projected at .56% and the lottery is estimated at $228 per student ($163 unrestricted, $65 restricted by
Proposition 20).
Staffing:Certificated staffing is based upon a ratio of 25:1 for TK, 30:1 for grades TK-6, and 32:1 for grades 7-12. Salaries
include step/column increases for certificated employees and step/range increases for classified employees. Statutory benefits
(STRS, PERS, Workers Compensation, etc.) are driven by payroll costs. Health benefits are based on current employer
contribution levels.
Expenditures:Supplies, services/operating expenses, and capital outlay are in conformity with the estimated site and program
budgets.
Ending Balance:For 2022-23, the restricted ending fund balance is comprised of:Expanded Learning Opportunities Program $4,600,820; Educator Effectiveness - $4,926,755; Special Education Early Intervention Preschool Grant - $2,717,819; A-G Grant
- $1,050,080, and Restricted Routine Maintenance - $1,139,081 for a total of $14,434,555.

$8,983,416
The total projected ending balance is $104,541,876 for 2022-23.The ending balance meets the State-required three-percent
reserve, and the 2022-23 Budget complies with the AB 1200 accountability guidelines as set forth by the State of California. This
includes the 10% reserve cap which was triggered for the 2022-23 year when the State's deposits into the Proposition 98 "Rainy
Day" Fund exceeded 3% of the total Proposition 98 expenditures for TK-12.
Unaudited actuals for 2021-22 and budget revisions for 2022-23 resulting from actual carryover and the adoption of the State of
California budget will be presented to the Board of Education at its September 8, 2022 meeting.
The First Interim Report is scheduled for December 14, 2022. The Second Interim Report will be presented in March 2023.
The 2021-22 Estimated Actuals and the 2022-23 Budget are available for public inspection at the District's Business Services

D. TECHNOLOGY SERVICES DEPARTMENT
REORGANIZATION

Meeting :

Jun 2, 2022 - Regular Board Meeting

Category :

7. ACTION ITEMS

Type :

Action

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the reconfiguration of the Technology Services
Department as presented.

Goals :

Focus Area 4.1
Focus Area 4.3

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Board Policy (BP 4000) sets forth the concept that the District is to maintain conditions in employment "that will
attract and hold the best qualified personnel for all positions." Board Policy (BP 2100) also requires that District administrative
staff be organized in a manner that best supports the educational program through efficient operations, effective communications
and direct assistance to schools.

Based upon these standards and the needs of the District as presented to the Board, it is recommended that the Technology
Services Department be reorganized in various tiers as described below for the 2022-2023 school year with new position
assignments to be effective July 1, 2022, or as soon as is permitted by statute, policy, and/or Collective Bargaining Agreement.
It is intended that any classified position elimination recommendations connected with this process be addressed through
attrition, so that no layoffs are contemplated by this recommended action.
The Orange Unified School District Technology Services Department supports approximately 26,500 students and nearly 3,500
employees within our District. In addition to these internal clients, the Department has also added support for an additional
14,000 student households. As the realities of the need for instructional support through technology increase, school district
technology support needs throughout the nation have become increasingly difficult to meet. One example of the increased need
can be seen in the increase in the number of devices supported by the District Technology Services Department. In 2019, the
Technology Services Department supported 38,148 individual devices. This number exploded to 77,496 devices in 2021. That is
an increase in over 100% in that short period of time. This kind of growth has challenged the Technology Services Department's
ability to meet the needs.
Making it more difficult to meet the needs is that the Technology Services Department has also struggled to find and retain
qualified employees over the past few years. The Technology Services Department has also found that other local entities have
routinely recruited OUSD employees for their openings. The recommendations associated with this reorganization are based on
the growing information technology needs of the students and staff of the District as well as current trends in staffing needs in the
field of information technology.
FISCAL IMPACT: It is estimated that there will be an ongoing cost to the unrestricted general fund of approximately $560,379
based upon the substance and funding of the reorganization.
RECOMMENDATION: It is recommended that the Board of Education approve the reconfiguration of the Technology Services
Department as follows:
Restore one month of service from 11 months to 12 months to classified unit positions (currently 10 positions)Information
Systems Specialist (salary range 47);
Restore one month of service from 11 months to 12 months to classified unit positions (currently 11 positions)
Technology Support Specialist (salary range 37);
Eliminate two classified unit positions (to go from 11 positions to 9 positions) Technology Support Specialist (salary range
37);
Add four classified unit positions Senior Technology Support Specialist (12 months, salary range 42);
Add 0.5 FTE classified unit position Senior Information Systems Specialist (12 months, salary range 53);
Eliminate two classified unit positions (to go from 4 positions to 2 positions) Network Technician (salary range 53);
Add one classified unit position Network Engineer (12 months, salary range 57);
Reclassify classified supervisor position User Support Supervisor (salary range L55) to Client Services Supervisor (salary
range L60);
Add one classified supervisor position Network Analyst/Supervisor (12 months, salary range L60);
Reclassify classified management position User Support Manager (salary range L68) to Assistant Director, Client
Services (salary range L84);
Reclassify classified management position Network Systems Manager (salary range L68) to Assistant Director, Network
and Systems (salary range L84);
Reclassify one classified management position Data and State Report Manager (salary range L66) to Assistant Director,
Data Architect (salary range L84).

that was opened on May 19, 2022.
Public Contract Code Section 20111 governs the letting of contracts for public works projects at schools. In addition to the Public
Contract Code, Courts have held that school districts may reject all bids for any reason and at any time before the bid has been
awarded. The Board of Education has the discretion and ability to award the contract or reject all bids.
Upon staff review and consideration, staff is recommending rejection of all bids and requesting authorization to re-bid the project.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will offer grant funding through the 2022 Clean School Bus
Rebates Program for clean school buses (compressed natural gas "CNG") and zero-emission school buses (electric). The grant
funding will be available in May 2022 and the deadline to apply is August 2022. Under Title XI: Clean School Buses and Ferries,
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides $5 billion over five years (FY 22-26) for the replacement of existing school buses
with CNG or Electric.
School districts applying directly for funds may only submit one application to replace up to 25 buses. Applicantsrequesting funds
to replace school buses that serve a school district that meets one or more of the prioritization criteria will be offered more
funding per bus and receive preference in the selection process. This grant funding will be offered in a lottery system and
awardees will be chosen using a random number generator process. Buses eligible for replacementmust be 2010 or older dieselpowered school buses that will be scrapped if selected for funding.

On April 14, 2022, the Board of Education approved Resolution 30-21-22 authorizing the District's participation in the HVIP 2022
grant program for zero-emission school buses. At the EPA workshop organized by Congresswoman Katie Porter and hosted by
Orange USD Transportation on May 10, 2022, we learned of the opportunity to stack grant funding awarded by the EPA with any
grant funding awarded by the HVIP 2022 grant program. Therefore, both awards, if granted, could cover most if not all costs
associated in acquiring new CNG or Electric school buses.
FISCAL IMPACT: Grantees are responsible for any costs over the EPAs award and as a recipient, if awarded, OUSD will receive
funding for up to $375,000 for zero-emission school buses and up to $45,000 for CNG school buses. Additionally, HVIP funding,
if awarded, would help to cover costs beyond the EPA's award. Therefore, the costs to OUSD would be minimal, if any at all.

the Ed Tech JPA Master Agreement.Pursuant to Public Contract Code section 20118.2, school districts have the authorization to

JPA Master Agreement No. 18/19-01-02, with a term of March 28, 2019, through March 27, 2024. Ed Tech JPA members may
leverage Master Agreements at any time within the contract term. The District desires to leverage the contract for a term of July
1, 2022, through June 30, 2025.
Staff has reviewed the terms, conditions, and pricing of the contract, including price as a significant factor, and finds them to be
