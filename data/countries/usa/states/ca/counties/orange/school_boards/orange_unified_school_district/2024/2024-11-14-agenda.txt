DESCRIPTION: As part of the Imperial Elementary Portable and Softball Field Improvements Project, the District must complete
an environmental study and process it through the County and State, in accordance with the California Environmental Quality
Act, when approving new projects that may affect District campus environments and the communities surrounding them.
Project Description:
Addition of one (1) portable classroom and softball field improvements atImperial Elementary School.
California Environmental Quality Act Compliance:
Projects undertaken by public agencies are subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) as outlined in Public
Resources Code (PRC) Section 21000 et seq. and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code Regulations, Title 14, Section
15000 et seq.). PRC section 21065 defines a project as follows:
Project means an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment or a reasonably
foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment
The proposedportable classroom and softball field improvements at Imperial Elementary School,are a Project under CEQA. Staff
has evaluated the Project as a whole and has determined that the proposed improvements are categorically exempt from further
environmental review and the provisions of CEQA under CEQA Guidelines Section 15314 Minor Additions To Schools and
Section 15301 Existing Facilities which states:
Class 14 consists of minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not
increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less. The addition of portable
classrooms is included in this exemption.
Class 1 consists of the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration of existing
public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features involving negligible or no
expansion of existing or former use.
Staff have determined that the Project is not subject to any exceptions to the categorical exemption (CEQA Guidelines Section
15314 and 15301). Therefore, the District may file a Notice of Exemption (NOE) for the Project, which exempts the Project from
further environmental review and the provisions of CEQA.
Current Considerations
Adoption of Resolution 10-24-25which provides the required acknowledgments and findings with respect to the Project at Imperial
Elementary Schoolto enable the District to:

1. Find the Proposed Project Exempt from CEQA
2. Approve the Filing and Recordation of a NOE
3. Approve the Project, and
4. Authorize staff to file the NOE for the Project with the appropriate public agencies.
Upon approval, the Notice of Exemption will be filed with the County Clerk and the State Office of Planning and Research (OPR).
The filing of a Notice of Exemption with the County Clerk starts a 35-day statute of limitations period on legal challenges to the
agency's decision that the project is exempt from CEQA.
FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact on the District. (Holguin/Vazquez)

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign

persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give the districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term needs.
This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential authorization for
one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover assignments
when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while searching for an
individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It also allows the
individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

FISCAL IMPACT:This item has no fiscal impact on the district.
