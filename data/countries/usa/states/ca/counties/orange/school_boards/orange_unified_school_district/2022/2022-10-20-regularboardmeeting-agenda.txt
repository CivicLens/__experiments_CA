DESCRIPTION: At the March 10, 2022 board meeting, the Board of Education approved the purchase of six electric vehicle
school buses to be paid for in part with monies awarded through the Hybrid Vehicle Incentive Program (HVIP) and in part with
financing the District would secure with a loan. In total, the grant would provide approximately 50% funding. However,given the
escalating interest rates in the current economy, and the availability of one-time monies from the State, the District seeks
approval from the Board to pay outright for the portion of the purchase that was to have been secured with a loan, thus saving
the District the interest expense involved in the purchase.

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of

waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover
assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

DESCRIPTION: Chapman University is conducting a study and desire to exchange performance data of the Program and of the
in-school reading performance of the students. The Study involves Chapman using the Identifiable Data and Blinded Data
provided by OUSD to perform an effectiveness study on the reading tutoring program at an Elementary School.
Students enrolled in the Program will have their in-school reading achievement levels compared to students not enrolled in the
Program. The aim of this Study is to gauge the impact of participation in the Program on students in-school reading achievement
levels. All comparisons of student data will be done after the Program ends and performed by Dr. Roxanne Greitz Miller, who is
not personally involved in the teaching of the reading tutoring course nor the delivery of the Program by Chapman students.
Chapman will provide OUSD with the Assessment Data within 30 days of the conclusion of the Program at an Elementary
(anticipated delivery January 2023).
OUSD will provide Chapman with in-school reading achievement data (the Identifiable Data and the Blinded Data) throughout
the fall and spring semesters of the 2022-23 academic year, in order to measure potential short-term and longer-term student
impact of participation. The Identifiable Data and Blinded Data will be delivered by OUSD to Chapman in January 2023 (inschool achievement data collected by OUSD from August 2022 to December 2022) and in June 2023 (data collected by OUSD
from January 2023 to June 2023).

SUPERINTENDENT

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education adopt
Resolution No. 11-22-23 granting signature authorization
for specific District administrative/leadership employees as
indicated on the attached document

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Authorization of signatures is an item that is routinely updated to reflect changes in personnel and to comply with
the requirements of the California Education Code.
As the agency which ultimately releases District payrolls and warrants, the Orange County Department of Education (OCDE)
must maintain on file the approved signature authorizations for all school districts. The signatures are applicable to various
documents which are approved by the Board of Education and in compliance with the Education Code and other pertinent state
and federal laws. The administrative/leadership employees for whom the signature authorizations are designated do not transfer
that authority to any staff members.
Purchase orders are processed within the limitations of existing site/program budgets, with the P.O. listing submitted to the
Board at each meeting. Non-routine expenditures for consultants, contracts, major facility additions, etc. are submitted to the
Board separately for authorization. Before the preparation of a warrant, it is determined that the proper authorization and
approvals exist. Warrants prepared by the District are forwarded to the OCDE for review of documentation, signature, and entry
to OUSDs county ledgers before they are returned to the District for release to vendors, consultants, or contractors. Purchase
orders, bid documents, warrants, payroll, federal/state/county documents, etc. are audited by the Districts independent audit firm.
FISCAL IMPACT:This item has no fiscal impact.
