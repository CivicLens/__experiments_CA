[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:47.000]   >> As a superintendent and former Panther principal,
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:51.000]   I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Board of Education,
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000]   Chair, Committee, and OUSD community.
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:56.000]   Your support and contributions have made this
[02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:59.000]   and our other Measure S facility improvements a reality.
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:02.000]   And for that, we're truly thankful.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000]   So thank you very much.
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:08.000]   Next, I just wanted to announce to the audience here,
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:11.000]   we are pleased to welcome Sulema Holguin,
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.000]   our new assistant superintendent of business services.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:18.000]   Sulema comes to OUSD from Belfar Unified
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:23.000]   with a career spanning over 27 years in public education,
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:27.000]   serving in multiple roles including instructional assistant,
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:31.000]   teacher, site administrator, district administrator,
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000]   and chief business official.
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.000]   Her proficiency in financial oversight and management
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:40.000]   extends across various departments within business services,
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000]   including nutrition services, facilities,
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.000]   maintenance and operations, payroll, and risk management.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:50.000]   Her broad educational experience makes her a great addition to our team.
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000]   Some fun facts about Sulema.
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:22:02.000]   She is a dedicated Raiders fan and will definitely not be rooting for the Steelers this season.
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:03.000]   Sorry, Dave.
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:09.000]   She's an avid runner and even completed a marathon in Ireland.
[02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000]   She is also an avid swimmer.
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:14.000]   She enjoys spending her free time with her family,
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000]   which includes her husband, daughter, and son.
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.000]   We look forward to Sulema's contributions as we continue our commitment
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:24.000]   to providing exceptional services to our students, staff, and community.
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.000]   That concludes my superintendent's report.
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:31.000]   Thank you.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.000]   And welcome, Sulema.
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000]   We're excited that you're here with us.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:43.000]   And just a little gift from the board and myself to welcome in here.
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:44.000]   Thank you.
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:45.000]   And thank you for the opportunity.
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000]   Excited to be OUSD team.
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:51.000]   Thank you.
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:56.000]   Next for the President's report.
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:00.000]   Many may think that there's not a lot happening over the summer,
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:04.000]   but hopefully it's an opportunity for our facilities and maintenance teams
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:07.000]   to really get into a lot of our classrooms,
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000]   all of our facilities, different campuses,
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.000]   and to really revitalize a lot of our learning spaces
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:17.000]   and get ready for our students to come back for the next school year.
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.000]   Some of the things that have been happening,
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:24.000]   if you've noticed in your own homeschool as you drive around town,
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:27.000]   taking your children to summer camps and different things,
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000]   there's new fencing being put up.
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:32.000]   Fire alarms are getting recertified.
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000]   A part of our safety plan.
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.000]   We've also added room numbers in order to be able to identify some of our classrooms
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000]   at different campuses.
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:47.000]   In addition, we've also had new roofs at five different schools.
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:51.000]   We've had blacktop resurfacing at two different schools,
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:55.000]   and there's a new playground at the Child Development Center.
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:59.000]   And HVAC replacements, there's been painting and flooring,
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000]   and so many different things.
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:06.000]   I'm sure there's more shade structures also being included in a lot of our elementary schools.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.000]   So a lot of the different things that we've been approving in our closed section items
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000]   have now come to fruition over the summer,
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:17.000]   and we're excited for our kids to have that first glimpse on the first day of school.
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:22.000]   In addition to that, I had the opportunity to visit a couple of our summer programs
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:26.000]   that I mentioned a couple of board meetings ago that we were offering.
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000]   There's an extended school year,
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000]   and we have great teams working with our students that have IUPs,
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:37.000]   and they've been really working to maintain the skills that our students have learned
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:41.000]   throughout the entire year so that they're ready on that first day of school.
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:46.000]   Many students have shared how excited they are to come to school every single day
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:53.000]   and work with their teams and also to socialize with each other to maintain those IUP goals.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:59.000]   In addition to that, I visited Mr. Gonzales Learning Links,
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000]   and if you don't know what Learning Links are,
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.000]   it's a program for a caregiver in a child that's zero to five.
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:09.000]   So anyone in the community can join,
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:16.000]   and there's multiple developmental activities that are hosted at different stations,
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:25.000]   and essentially you see grandparents, caregivers, parents just coming in with their infants and toddlers,
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:29.000]   and they get to experience a lot of different things, so it's really nice to see that,
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:34.000]   and it's going to continue on through August 1st at two different sites at Palmyra and at Handy,
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:39.000]   and then we'll have additional sites morning and afternoon sessions, I believe,
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:44.000]   being hosted throughout the school year, so definitely look out for that.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:53.000]   And then in the last four weeks, we've also had a Mandarin summer camp hosted at Sarasala Middle School,
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:58.000]   and our Mandarin immersion students, I believe there were a hundred students that attended,
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:05.000]   including my two at home, attended Mandarin language instruction,
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000]   and it was for the first three hours of the morning,
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:14.000]   and then the last three hours of the afternoon were specific to cultural experiences like Chinese yoyo,
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:19.000]   fan dance, there were so many different performances that were happening,
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:24.000]   but at least I noticed in my own two children coming home and speaking Mandarin, especially to each other,
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:28.000]   so now that's a new challenge that I get to fix at home.
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:34.000]   It's a great opportunity, it's not a challenge that our kids get to learn new languages,
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.000]   but it's just some highlights that have been happening over the summer,
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.000]   and I'm really looking forward to the new school year.
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.000]   And now we move on to board recognition of students, staff, and community.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:53.000]   Are there any board members who would like to share?
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:57.000]   I'll see you in a sec.
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000]   Thank you.
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:03.000]   I hope everyone is having a enjoyable summer and a great Independence Day.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:08.000]   I joined the Kenyan Education Foundation at the fireworks booth one day,
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:14.000]   and I'd like to thank all the amazing volunteers who came out and worked those booths because it was hot,
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:20.000]   but they're raising money for their respective boosters, and that's really impressive.
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:26.000]   Not only at Kenyan, but Boulepark High School as well, so I'd like to thank all of our volunteers once again.
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.000]   And speaking of volunteers, and I know many of you may not want to hear this,
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:36.000]   but we're gearing up for school, so I know the PTAs are working hard,
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:40.000]   so I'd like to encourage everyone to join their PTAs,
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:45.000]   and the new boards are all gathering and getting together and planning for the school year,
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:50.000]   to acknowledge them for all their work because without them, you know,
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:53.000]   our district would not be what it is today.
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.000]   And lastly, Trustee Page mentioned it,
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.000]   and I also attended the OUSD Mandarin Immersion Summer Camp Program,
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:10.000]   and she spoke on most everything except I want to say that their Mandarin proficiency continues to amaze me.
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:14.000]   I'm Chinese, and I don't speak Chinese, so it's kind of embarrassing.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:20.000]   But they just blow me away because at least I can kind of hear some of the intonations, and they got it.
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.000]   So it was a treat to see them perform,
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:28.000]   and one of the other treats was they had expert teachers coming from Taiwan,
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:33.000]   and they were teaching the kids dancing and the yo-yo-ing,
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.000]   and they did a demonstration themselves, so it was really impressive.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:42.000]   And another thing they did is they brought in a renowned Chinese calligrapher,
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:50.000]   and he did a live demonstration for the students and created these beautiful signs with the Chinese characters,
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000]   and so that was really neat to see.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:57.000]   So I want to thank not only the Global Culture Education Foundation who sponsored it,
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:05.000]   but the volunteers, the teachers, and the student volunteers at CV who helped to make this program great,
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:11.000]   or created this opportunity for our students, so it was wonderful.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000]   Thank you for sharing.
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000]   Trustee Kelly.
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000]   Thank you, Madam President.
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000]   Just a quick comment or two.
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:26.000]   It's just exciting to see during summer, as you mentioned, that there's so much going on.
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:32.000]   You think summer people take a break, and I think that's probably one of the most important and busiest times in the district office.
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:36.000]   We would always say see you in the fall, and the district office people would look at us like really.
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:43.000]   You think we're going anywhere, and all the construction and the maintenance and things, projects that are going on.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:51.000]   But I have not been able to be here to visit, but I love social media because I've been watching all of these great summer programs that are going on at the schools,
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:57.000]   and not just the fact that they're addressing learning loss, which does happen in the summer,
[02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:01.000]   but for the kids who are really the most susceptible to it.
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:07.000]   It's really preventing learning loss. We see it happen when they come back in the fall, but we don't have to do all the catch up.
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:10.000]   Teachers can just kind of jump right in with a lot of these kids.
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:17.000]   But also, they're making it fun in these cultural activities, you know, the Mandarin Immersion Program, all those great cultural activities.
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:23.000]   And I saw, I don't know if it was Cambridge, but a couple of the schools were doing cooking classes,
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:26.000]   and I'm just watching this thinking this is so fun.
[02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:30.000]   I would have never wanted to go to summer school back when we had it because it was not fun.
[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000]   We didn't do cooking. We didn't do any of that stuff.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:39.000]   So I just really wanted to give a shout out to all of the people that are putting those programs together because it is a lot of work.
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:43.000]   And they're working during their summer, but it's really helping our kids and helping learning loss.
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:48.000]   So thank you to all of the people who are involved with that.
[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000]   Thank you, Trustee Pelley.
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000]   Trustee Boss?
[02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000]   Good evening.
[02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:01.000]   Good evening. And similar to Ms. Pelley, Trustee Pelley, I was out of town right after the 3rd of July celebration.
[02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:07.000]   So again, that's been my first 3rd of July celebration here at Groudon Park, which is very nice, very welcoming.
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:13.000]   And right after that, on a plane to Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas.
[02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:16.000]   We drove to Kansas City, Kansas for a footsault tournament.
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:19.000]   If you know what footsault is, I'll give you a quarter.
[02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:25.000]   But it's similar to soccer. My daughter was in a tournament out there, which is really exciting for her.
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:32.000]   And it made me think more about some of our sports and our activities that are going on in our district that students need to be involved in,
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:37.000]   but also not necessarily become a pro, but just to have some interaction with their colleagues.
[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:47.000]   So I just want to thank everyone who's gone on the different expeditions, not just to different sites, but also through social media and seeing what's going on in our districts.
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:53.000]   A lot of things are happening that are very positive. So thank you.
[02:31:53.000 --> 02:32:01.000]   Thank you, Trustee Gras. Trustee Erickson. Yes, just quickly, I wanted to thank the communications department for your lovely Measure S presentation.
[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:08.000]   And I just want to remind and thank everybody again for all of their hard work to get Measure S passed.
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:17.000]   It was an enormous pull for so many volunteers that have maintained their volunteer status throughout the years.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:26.000]   But it's incredible to think how that started and how then superintendent Mike Christensen called four parents together.
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:37.000]   Trustee Elmasaki, myself, Mr. Greenwald, Mr. Jacoby, and we literally sat around my kitchen table and that was how that Measure K movement started.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:46.000]   And then it just built and we, not we, but volunteers everywhere worked so hard for three years to get that passed.
[02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:55.000]   So this is such a long time coming. And to see these buildings at Warnch High being completed, it just, it warms my heart.
[02:32:55.000 --> 02:33:07.000]   And I'm so grateful to the volunteers, the taxpayers that are paying the bond and the people that are building and the people that are maintaining because this is such an incredibly important thing for our students.
[02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:16.000]   They deserve to have the safest, cleanest state-of-the-art facilities and that's what we want to provide to our students on every campus.
[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:20.000]   And that's what we're going to strive to do. So thank you.
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:27.000]   Thank you, Trustee Erickson and our student board member, Alex.
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:45.000]   Thanks.
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:46.000]   Perfect. Thank you very much.
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:57.000]   Unfortunately, I didn't draft up exactly something for the board recognition of staff, students and community, albeit it'll be very short. So there is a lot, a lot of construction over at Oak Park High School.
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.000]   It does seem like a shiv yard. I think there's so much of that construction, right?
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:14.000]   I'm repeating the size of our school, white, saturated grade that we had previously. We're also doing major developments with the gym that we have, as well as our four other school sites, high school specifically.
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:22.000]   And also we're making major advancements with the miniaturized-faced suit building that we have for our English and math departments.
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:31.000]   And so I go on walks right now, right near the town center, and I'm like, wow, the miniaturized suit building is just so different when we first started.
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:44.000]   And in continuation with that, we are also doing a lot of stuff in specifics with our student organizations and our ASB in gearing up for registration this upcoming month, August.
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:47.000]   And that's all I have to say. Thank you very much.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:52.000]   Thank you.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:55.000]   Number six, public comment.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:13.000]   We have public comment on items, item 7a, we have three, and then we have 8a and then some non-agenda items.
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:18.000]   Okay, how many are there?
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.000]   There's three for 7a.
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:30.000]   Oh, I'm sorry. Can we, if it's okay with the board, can we just do the non-agenda since there's only three?
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:38.000]   Oh, I'm sorry. For non-agenda, 7a has three, 8a has one, and then we have four for non-agenda.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:43.000]   Okay, the four non-agenda. Does it? Non-agenda.
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000]   Can we just do that?
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000]   I'm fine with it.
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000]   Okay, okay.
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:56.000]   So do you want to do non-agenda first because 7a is the next item? Okay, so non-agenda is first. Okay.
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:07.000]   So the first non-agenda speaker is Tanya Esperi.
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:11.000]   Okay, I'll, she'll be on deck, so we'll call her when she comes back in.
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:21.000]   Jolynn.
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:26.000]   Hello, trustees. I would like to take you a moment and just tell you a little story real quick.
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:33.000]   This story is about a five-year-old kid who did cheer with the local cheer group in the winter.
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:38.000]   They had a great time. They wore the same uniform as the other cheerleaders.
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:44.000]   It was exciting and fun. They signed up to do summer cheer, and they got there.
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:51.000]   And they were informed that unless they wore their assigned gender at birth-specific clothing as a five-year-old,
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000]   they would not be allowed to participate in cheer.
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:59.000]   They were not allowed to wear the same cheer skirt that everyone else was wearing.
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:04.000]   They had to wear shorts or else they were not allowed to participate.
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:09.000]   And as what makes this even worse is the five-year-old was told before the parent could even get there.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:14.000]   So they were sitting there crying as the parent walked up.
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:24.000]   Now, what makes this important to you guys is this is the I-9 franchise 305, which uses the Fletcher School Facility.
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:31.000]   And not only that, they have signs and posters outside of a lot of our schools advertising their group telling kids
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:37.000]   they're a great inclusive organization. They have co-ed sports for boys and girls, come and join it.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:45.000]   It's just they're not saying that we only have sports for cis-presenting boys and girls.
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:48.000]   And that's not what the district should be standing for.
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:51.000]   And I don't know how the rules for rentals work. I'm looking into that.
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:59.000]   But I do know that we shouldn't be advertising that type of discriminatory group at all of our school sites.
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:04.000]   I do know they're a franchise, so I'm not saying that this is reflective of all of I-9 sports,
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:10.000]   just specifically the ones that operate in Norval and Orange and the Red Hills School.
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:16.000]   Specifically, this happened at Fletcher, but this was from the top down affecting all of those.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:23.000]   So I would appreciate it if you could look into and maybe make sure we're not promoting a discriminatory organization.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:38.000]   Thank you.
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:51.000]   Okay, she's still on deck. Carlos Sanchez.
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:54.000]   Hi, school board members. My name is Carlos.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:39:00.000]   Damn, I haven't attended a school board meeting in a minute, but I was really upset with what happened with Madison,
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:07.000]   mine and Rick with Desma. You know, I don't like what's going on with a lot of things in the school systems.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:16.000]   And I hate to see, I hate to see, I hate to see what was going on and me as being another Hispanic fan
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:21.000]   that grew up here in the Orange and the Red Hills School District. I went to VP.
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:36.000]   I'm just really mind blown, mind blown about it by you guys, so that's all I have to say.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:42.000]   Tonya, Tonya. Are you here?
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:48.000]   Okay, we'll go with Darshan Smollett and you'll wave it off. Okay.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:53.000]   Well, Tonya, it's your turn.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:40:03.000]   Okay.
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:13.000]   Thank you.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:23.000]   Thank you.
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:41.000]   My phone wasn't letting me get into this.
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:49.000]   All right. Good evening, Board of Trustees, Superintendent Gonzalez, Cabinet and members of the community. My name is Tonya Sperry.
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:58.000]   I'm the president of CSA Orange Chapter 67. We're the union that represents approximately 1,300 classified staff at Orange Unified School District.
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000]   Sorry.
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:06.000]   Today, I'm here tonight to advocate for the inclusion of reclassification process in our collective bargaining agreement.
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:10.000]   Why are we negotiating reclassification language?
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:20.000]   Classified staff communicated that the reclassification process that OUSD has been unclear for years. The benefit of adding this contract language is as follows.
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:27.000]   Transparency, understanding, the reclassification process.
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:37.000]   Prevents protections if the process is not followed. CSA's stance is that the law defines reclassification as a mandatory subject of bargaining.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:45.000]   This means negotiation reclassification is a right of the union and its members, whether the language is included in the contract or not.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:42:01.000]   Adding the process creates a clear understanding for both members and the district alike. The district's proposals attempt to reduce some of membership's other rights as a trade-off to adding a clearly defined reclassification process to the contract.
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:09.000]   Our stance is that membership should not be penalized for expecting a transparent process and appropriate pay for service performed.
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:19.000]   OUSD has committed to four goals, values, equity, integrity, respect, and excellence.
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:28.000]   Yet the contract includes many waivers of our most fundamental rights. Moving forward, waivers of our rights will not be considered.
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:38.000]   Any of the district's attempts to waive our rights are considered incredibly disrespectful when we too contribute to the success of the district and its students.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:43.000]   We are truly valued.
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:49.000]   Yes, the Governing Board ensured that the district demonstrates at the table.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:53.000]   I respectfully thank you for all your considerations. Thank you.
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:43:07.000]   Thank you. Thank you all for being here tonight.
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:17.000]   7A Public Hearing Charter School Renewal Petition by Al Rancho Charter School. Mr. Gonzalez, do we take those now or do we take them apart?
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:31.000]   We may want to ask those who submitted blue cards what they intended to do because typically we open up the public hearing and then we don't require blue cards, but if that's their intent, then we'll just make sure that they get called up first.
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:53.000]   Perhaps those people that turned in the blue cards for the Al Rancho Renewal Public Hearing could let us know if that's okay to just include you as part of the public hearing or if you'd like to be heard separately before we begin the discussion on the item.
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:57.000]   Okay, so we'll just take care of it during the public hearing portion then.
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:00.000]   Okay. Thank you.
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:19.000]   So I will now close the regular meeting and open the public hearing on the Al Rancho Charter Renewal Request at 738 PM.
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000]   Thank you.
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:32.000]   Good evening, President Page, Trustees, staff, and community. We are here this evening for the public hearing on the request for a renewal of Charter for Al Rancho Charter School.
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:41.000]   Charter School renewals were on hiatus for three years due to lack of statewide academic data because of COVID.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:54.000]   And for that reason, Al Rancho's current Charter term runs through June 30, 2025. In the 2024-25 school year, we are restarting the Charter Renewal process.
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:45:05.000]   The process consists of the school submitting a Charter Renewal petition, the Board of Education holding a required public hearing on the renewal petition.
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:13.000]   The district staff analyzing the renewal request against the standards for renewals set forth in the Charter School Act.
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:23.000]   Staff will publish its recommendations, including recommended findings at least 15 days before the meeting at which the district board will act on the request.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:32.000]   There were significant changes to the Charter School Act, including relative to Charter Renewal, which became affected in 2020.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:41.000]   Because of renewal, Charter Schools are now divided into four categories based on their performance on local and statewide indicators.
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:53.000]   During the two consecutive years immediately preceding the renewal decision, high, middle, low, and dashboard alternative status schools called DASS.
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:46:01.000]   The permanent renewal standards and most available length of the renewal term are dependent on the categorization.
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:06.000]   Most Charter Schools will be in the middle performing and eligible for five-year renewals.
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:11.000]   High performing Charters may be renewed for terms five to seven years.
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:20.000]   Low performing schools for which the Charter authorizer makes an exception and renews the Charter may only be renewed for two years.
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:29.000]   The California Department of Education has certified Rancho as a high performing Charter School for the purposes of this renewal.
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:35.000]   So the district board may renew its Charter for five, six, or seven years.
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:46.000]   Rancho submitted its renewal petition on June 17, 2024, and is requesting that the board renew its Charter for an additional seven-year term.
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:56.000]   The Charter Schools Act provides that within 60 days of submission of the renewal petition, the district board of education is to hold the public hearing on the provisions of the Charter,
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:05.000]   at which time the board shall consider the level of support for the renewal petition by district teachers and other district employees and parents and guardians.
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:18.000]   The board's decision on the renewal of the Charter should occur within 90 days of receipt unless that time is extended by an additional 30 days by mutual agreement between the district and Rancho.
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:28.000]   The board's decisions on Rancho's renewal request is anticipated to be included on the board's September 12, 2024 meeting agenda.
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:38.000]   Staff working with legal counsel as appropriate will review and analyze Rancho's request for Charter renewal in compliance with the requirements of the Charter Schools Act.
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:58.000]   The analysis will be completed in the upcoming weeks, and staff's recommendation and recommended findings will be published at least 15 days prior to the board's action on this item, which is anticipated to be by August 28 for the September 12 meeting.
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000]   Thank you.
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:05.000]   So, does El Rancho wish to meet the presentation regarding the Charter request?
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:14.000]   Okay, please come up.
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:21.000]   Good evening, members of the Orange Unified School District Board, esteemed colleagues, parents, and community members.
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:36.000]   My name is Michelle Walker, and I'm the executive director at El Rancho Charter School. I am honored to stand before you today to highlight the remarkable achievements of our school and to explain why we should earn a seven-year renewal.
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:50.000]   Our journey has been marked by 22 years of the academic excellence, financial stability, the fostering of a supportive and inclusive environment, and a commitment to continuous improvement.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:55.000]   First, I would like to highlight our academic successes.
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:02.000]   Our students have consistently demonstrated outstanding performance across various metrics.
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:13.000]   Our standardized test scores have seen significant improvements with a notable increase in proficiency levels in both math and English language arts.
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:25.000]   A variety of interventions in student learning is crucial to address diverse educational needs and ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:35.000]   Different students require tailored approaches to overall individual challenges and maximize their academic potential.
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:48.000]   This is a testament to the dedication of our teachers who have implemented innovative teaching strategies and personalized learning plans to meet the diverse needs of our students.
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:50:04.000]   In addition to our academic milestones, El Rancho has been recognized for its many achievements, including a California Distinguished School in 2005, 2013, and most recently in 2024.
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:14.000]   This prestigious honor is awarded to schools that demonstrate exceptional student performance and progress in narrowing the achievement gap.
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:27.000]   Our designation as a California Distinguished School is a direct result of our collaborative efforts to create a learning environment that encourages every student to reach their full potential.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:37.000]   In addition, El Rancho has been named California and National Schools to Watch in 2023 by the California League of Educators.
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:43.000]   El Rancho is ranked in the top 10% of all middle schools in California.
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:51.000]   A highlight was being named the number one middle school in Orange County by the Orange County Register.
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:51:04.000]   El Rancho provides the opportunity to offer over 30 different electives and fosters a love of learning by allowing students to explore their interests and discover new passions.
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:16.000]   Engaging students in diverse subjects helps them to develop a well-rounded education and keeps them motivated and excited about their school experience.
[02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:25.000]   El Rancho Charter School maintains strong financial stability, crucial for its continued success and operational efficiency.
[02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:38.000]   Our ability to effectively manage resources ensures that we can provide a high quality education, support various programs, and maintain its facilities.
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:53.000]   Financial stability also enables the school to attract and retain qualified staff, invest in innovative teaching methods, and meet the diverse needs of its student population.
[02:51:53.000 --> 02:52:12.000]   Given these accomplishments, it is clear why we seek to obtain a seven-year renewal. This renewal is not just an acknowledgement of our past achievements, but also a vote of confidence in our ongoing efforts to provide a high quality education for all of our students.
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:34.000]   In conclusion, our school has demonstrated that we are not just meeting but exceeding educational standards. Our hard-working and dedicated staff of teachers, administrators, and support personnel go above and beyond every day to ensure that our students receive the best possible education.
[02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:43.000]   Our academic success and the collaborative spirit of our staff and community are all reasons why we should earn this seven-year renewal.
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:53.000]   I am confident that with your continued support, we will continue to excel and provide our students with the best possible education.
[02:52:53.000 --> 02:53:10.000]   Thank you, and at this time, I would like to introduce our assistant principal, Kenya Ozuna, who will present on our academic achievement.
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:19.000]   Good evening esteemed board members, parents, and community members. My name is Kenya Ozuna, and I am one of the assistant principals at Al Rancho Trotter School.
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:31.000]   Today, I am here to advocate for the seven-year renewal of our school. A key measure of our school's success is our standardized test scores, which are consistently among the best in the region.
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:39.000]   Al Rancho's student test scores in English, Math, and Science are a testament to the school's commitment to academic excellence.
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:45.000]   Al Rancho has consistently outperformed middle schools within our surrounding area.
[02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:57.000]   This past school year, Al Rancho's Math and Science scores are on average 15% higher, and our English scores are approximately 20% higher than districts in our surrounding area.
[02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:05.000]   Our English data reflects the rigorous curriculum and dedicated teaching staff that Al Rancho prides itself on.
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:10.000]   When looking at Math data, Al Rancho students demonstrate remarkable proficiency.
[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:23.000]   The hands-on problem-solving approach adopted by our Math teachers encourages students to think critically and apply their knowledge in practical situations, resulting in high test scores.
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:32.000]   Lastly, Al Rancho's Science scores are equally impressive, demonstrating our students' comprehensive understanding and enthusiasm for the subject.
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:46.000]   Our inquiry-based learning model and state-of-the-art Science labs engage students in hands-on experiments and critical thinking exercises, fostering a deep appreciation and understanding of scientific concepts.
[02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:52.000]   When we compare our scores to middle schools around us, the distinction becomes even clearer.
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:55:06.000]   Although the neighboring districts offer solid academic programs, Al Rancho scores surpass theirs, highlighting the effectiveness of our teaching strategies and the exceptional caliber of our dedicated students and staff.
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:14.000]   These comparisons clearly demonstrate that Al Rancho not only excels but leads in academic performance across subjects.
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:24.000]   Our outstanding test scores are a testament to our dedicated staff, rigorous academic programs, and the hard-working students who strive for excellence every day.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:33.000]   The renewal of our charter for another seven years is crucial for continuing to provide exceptional educational opportunities for our students.
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:43.000]   Your support will ensure that we can maintain and even surpass our current standards, helping to shape the future leaders of our community.
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000]   Thank you for your time and consideration.
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:56.000]   Please allow me to introduce Ben Loeffler, who will discuss Al Rancho's financial stability.
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:03.000]   Good evening, board members, Superintendent Gonzalez, members of the cabinet, and members of the audience.
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:08.000]   My name is Frances Loeffler, and I am the CBO for Al Rancho Charter School.
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:15.000]   I am honored to speak with you today about the vital importance of renewing our extraordinary charter school for a seven-year term.
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:19.000]   This renewal is crucial for continuing our trajectory of success.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:26.000]   Our school's financial stability and responsibility has been a cornerstone of that success.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:35.000]   We have managed our resources prudently, ensuring that every dollar spent effectively to enhance the educational experience of our students.
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:48.000]   This financial stewardship has allowed us to enjoy a balanced budget while investing in significant areas such as the stellar teaching and support staff, student programs, and campus improvements.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:59.000]   Since you have our detailed financial reports in your pockets, I wanted to address our philosophy and results of having a healthy sound fiscal standing.
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:05.000]   Enrollment equals revenue and is the primary indicator of our success.
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:11.000]   In a declining enrollment climate, we are increasing by 30 students this year.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:19.000]   Our substantial waitlist for open enrollment in inter-district transfers is a testament to the high-quality education that we provide.
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:28.000]   The waitlist underscores the need for a continued operation to serve students who are eager to join our thriving educational community.
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:36.000]   Our current enrollment also has over 50 students who come to us from private elementary or into the area.
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:43.000]   Having a robust inter-district transfer enrollment not only benefits El Rancho, but has benefited OUSD as well.
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:51.000]   Historically, some students from other districts who choose to come to our school then choose to attend a high school in Orange Unified.
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:55.000]   Our three-year projections are consistently accurate.
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:58:01.000]   This ensures that we always meet the goals of our LCAP while being prepared for unknown obstacles.
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:04.000]   In future years, we budget extremely conservatively.
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:08.000]   Charter schools are funded on current year ADA.
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:14.000]   Attendance is so important, and we ended this year just under 96 percent.
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:22.000]   Cashflow is another marker in a fiscally sound operation, and we are estimated to maintain our current levels.
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:30.000]   We have prioritized campus-wide improvements to ensure that our facilities are safe, productive, and welcoming.
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:34.000]   The safety and well-being of our students and staff are always a primary concern.
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:45.000]   Recent upgrades include upgrading to 80 security cameras, adding vape sensors in all the student restrooms, a lockdown system, 5 AEDs campus-wide,
[02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:52.000]   radios for all instructional aids and safety teams, and a guest ID verification, to name a few.
[02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:55.000]   Technology is an area that we cannot skimp on.
[02:58:55.000 --> 02:59:01.000]   We have one-to-one student Chromebooks in all core foreign language and special education classrooms.
[02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:05.000]   Our tech lab was recently equipped with 42 IMAX.
[02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:13.000]   We outfitted most classrooms with 75-inch TVs to replace projectors, and we are undergoing a total wireless upgrade.
[02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:25.000]   We vigorously maintain, and when resources are available, make significant upgrades to the outreach of site to help foster innovation and collaboration among our students and staff.
[02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:32.000]   Every year, we receive a good or exemplary suit report, and a rating that exceeds 95 percent.
[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:41.000]   We recently remodeled two-thirds of our student restrooms, updated our library, opened the coyote den, which is a welcoming space for all students,
[02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:57.000]   resurfaced old brick with non-apox, with non-slip epoxy in our atrium, replaced evaporative coolers, refit updated HVAC controllers, and replaced some carpeting with high-traffic carpetiles.
[02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:08.000]   These improvements not only enhance the daily experience of our students, but also ensure that our campus remains a vibrant and inspiring place for education.
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:15.000]   In 2017, we completed construction of our gymnasium, science center, and dam studio.
[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:21.000]   These additions were designed to provide our student population with the facilities they needed to excel.
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:28.000]   The gym also provides a space for students to continue to be active without interruption during inclement weather.
[03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:33.000]   We also enhanced the weight room to support our athletic programs.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:47.000]   From our modern science labs to our CIF regulation gym that generates over 120,000 in revenue, we are proud to offer the facility to the OUSD schools as well at half the cost.
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:56.000]   Dam studio supports a growing number of interested students, and we redesigned our weight room for a new strength and conditioning classes.
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:01:01.000]   The gym is in great demand and is admired throughout the county.
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:08.000]   We are in our seventh year of our long-time repayment of the COP, which was used to pay off the construction loan.
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:19.000]   We maintain a full year's payment plus an additional fall P&I in the ending fund in order to ensure our fiduciary responsibility.
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:28.000]   Our seven-year term renewal is essential for sustaining and building upon the impressive standards we have set in achieving a bright and promising future.
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:32.000]   We make relevant choices that spur enrollment.
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:47.000]   As proven for 22 years, we are well-equipped professionals using our expertise in providing high-quality academics for all students and demonstrating the ability to make prudent decisions while operating with fidelity.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:57.000]   As you consider the level of support for our renewal, the consistency of interest in our school demonstrates the high level of support you are looking for.
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:04.000]   With your support, we can ensure that our school remains a beacon of excellence in the Orange Unified School District.
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:08.000]   Together, we can achieve great things for our students and our community.
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:12.000]   Thank you for your consideration, and I'd like to reintroduce Mrs. Walker.
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:37.000]   Key takeaways from El Rancher Charter School include our designation as the high-track charter school, our rank in the top 10% of California middle schools, our high proficiency rates in math, English, and science, as well as over 30 elective choices that engage our students.
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:52.000]   This school is recognized for its dedicated and hard-working staff, strong community support, indicated by a long wait list, and financial stability that allows for effective resource management.
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:03:01.000]   These factors contribute to a positive educational environment and support the school's reputation has for excellence.
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:11.000]   Your unwavering support and commitment to El Rancher Charter School will enable us to continue our exceptional educational program for our students.
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:18.000]   Thank you to the families, staff, and community members for attending this evening. Thank you.
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:34.000]   Thank you for your presentation. We will now take public comment on this item. Speakers shall direct their comments to the board and are urged to avoid repeating points made by previous speakers.
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:56.000]   We have three blue cards that were submitted and then obviously anybody can speak after that as well. First speaker is Karen Barone, and on deck after her is Frank Dunn.
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:05.000]   Good evening. My name is Karen Barone. I'm a teacher and parent of a recent OUSD grad and an incoming ninth grade student at Orange, and I'm here to speak about the El Rancher Charter renewal.
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:22.000]   As a parent, not as a teacher and not as an OUA member. My daughter, Eva, attended El Rancher for seventh and eighth grade. She had wonderful teachers, including Patrick Herron, Matthew Trey, Allison Reege, Joe Romero, Allison Jordan, Francie Reiser, and Leah LaRue.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:36.000]   During Eva's eighth grade year, she had two open heart surgeries causing her to miss a lot of school. Her teachers were incredibly supportive, sending care packages and checking in regularly, and I'm deeply grateful for the teaching staff at El Rancher.
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:55.000]   However, I have some concerns regarding this charter renewal, particularly with Michelle Walker and Fran Loeffler. Despite claims of financial stability, the PTA asked the community for money to remodel the bathrooms they just told you about, and have cut electives like home economics, and Michelle and Fran continue to give themselves exorbitant raises.
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:05:07.000]   The charter states the executive director should be an exemplary communicator with strong organizational skills. Michelle Walker does not meet the standard. When I reached out to her with concerns, responses came from other admin, not her.
[03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:14.000]   Other parents have shared similar experiences with me, and this avoidance of conflict and lack of direct communication is troubling.
[03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:29.000]   Furthermore, the charter states that teacher applicants will be screened and interviewed, but often family members or friends of Fran Loeffler are hired without public posting. My daughter actually had her daughter as a long-term sub who was unqualified, consistently losing student work and making excuses.
[03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:47.000]   Bullying and student mental health are also significant issues. My daughter was continually harassed, and when she stood up for her, she was reprimanded by Michelle Walker instead of the bullies. When I asked if the school offered any lessons on bullying or restorative circles to address this with students, I was told no, we don't have those problems here in El Rancher.
[03:05:47.000 --> 03:06:03.000]   I've sent more detailed lists to Board President Page on my concerns. These are just a few of the issues that I highlight. The poor leadership of Michelle and Fran, they treat the school as their own, not the communities, despite claims that teachers and parents are involved in decision making.
[03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:18.000]   They're often excluded. Teachers and parents have shared stories with me of their difficulties working with both of them. I urged the Board to delay the approval the next month to allow more community input and spend the next month discussing with staff to understand the real situation at the school.
[03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:45.000]   If the charter is approved tonight, it should come with some amendments. Remove Michelle and Fran and hire a new leadership. Elect a new school board without the principal running the meetings, without being a voting member or running elections for the school board, have a district office personnel oversee those board elections for transparency, and assign one district liaison who will attend board meetings for a minimum of three years for continuity and effective oversight instead of someone new every year.
[03:06:45.000 --> 03:07:03.000]   And reinstate the additions or deletions of specific items that can be made to the El Rancher charter by a 75% vote of the El Rancher staff rather than the current 51% vote. Thank you for your time.
[03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:14.000]   Next up is Frank Dunn, followed by Jessica Allen.
[03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:28.000]   Good evening. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I'm here for two reasons. One is a parent was unable to attend their overseas on vacation and so they asked me to read the statement to you about the charter. So I'll do that first.
[03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:44.000]   This is a statement from DeRise Liu. It says dear OUSD board. I'm writing in support of El Rancher charter school. I hope you will vote in favor of renewing the charter. I have three children who received their middle school education at El Rancho.
[03:07:44.000 --> 03:08:04.000]   My eldest son, Jason, is now a college at UCLA. My middle child, Maline, will be attending UC Berkeley in late August. My youngest, Kayla, just promoted from the upgraded El Rancher charter school. All three have had the most outstanding teachers who have challenged them and encouraged them to thrive.
[03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:16.000]   A few teachers that I have that I've heard my children talk about include Mr. Strefus and honors math teacher whose motto is to take students from that's outstanding and make them extraordinary.
[03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:24.000]   Mrs. Olson, the band and orchestra teacher who has amazingly transformed their squeaky blows into beautiful music.
[03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:36.000]   Mrs. Jordan, a science teacher who also is strongly ethical and a great role model for young girls. Mr. Hammond, the Spanish teacher who makes learning Spanish interactive, fun and easy.
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:56.000]   And Mrs. Rodriguez, an honors history teacher that challenges them every day. And many, many more. My children received a strong academic foundation during Anaheim Hills Elementary in El Rancher charter school, which has helped my oldest two to succeed in high school and for my son to succeed in college.
[03:08:56.000 --> 03:09:06.000]   I'm unable to attend the thanks board meeting personally because I'm on vacation overseas. Please accept these few words through the C now. Sincerely, Therese Liu.
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:19.000]   So that was that. And I also just in the time remaining, I am also a parent and OUSU, OUSD, all three of my children went through El Rancher charter school and had a wonderful opportunity.
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:28.000]   So I'd like to thank the teachers and the staff and everybody there. I've had nothing but positive experience at the school.
[03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:38.000]   When my kids were attending, my kids still use the school as part of the athletic programs that are functioned through the gymnasium and so on there.
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:51.000]   More often than I probably should be driving and profing kids off and seeing everything that goes on there and the school is just a wonderful place. I like I said, I've had nothing but positive experience with the staff and the teachers and the administration.
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:10:02.000]   So I would of course support the extension and their charter. Thank you very much.
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:10.000]   Next speaker is Jessica Allen.
[03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:16.000]   Good evening. My name is Jessica Allen. I'm a school psychologist at El Rancher charter school.
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:26.000]   About seven years ago, I called El Rancher an hour before my interview to cancel it. I was offered an opportunity in another district and I was happy to take it.
[03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:34.000]   El Rancher said, no, you need to come to our school. You will be impressed. There will be no questions after you come. It's a really special program.
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:42.000]   Well, I had a nine month old as a time and I rushed over to my in-laws dropped him off. I was like, I can't turn that down. They basically told me no.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:57.000]   I need to hold my appointment. I got there and I'm sure glad I did. I do really feel like El Rancher has been a special home for students as they go through that hugely transitional period going from basically childhood to their teenage years.
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:11.000]   As I said, I'm a school psychologist and I'm actually one of two school psychologists is on campus and that's just one of the special ways that El Rancher has tried to meet the needs of their students by funding two full-time school psychologists.
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:27.000]   I'm not just a tester. I'm not just a report writer. I get to help with all students and I'm so thankful that I get to be involved in a more meaningful way than just helping our special ed students, which is a huge priority of ours as well.
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:39.000]   I do feel like we have a robust special ed department in part because there's two of us, but it's also just this mindset of prioritizing all students and their mental health.
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:57.000]   I do feel that anytime I have a conflict and I go to our leadership and I say, what do I do here? And they say prioritize the students needs, which is such a great relief to me as a professional was me to do my job in the spirit of my beliefs and where my heart lies.
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:08.000]   So I'm happy to be a part of a team that really, you know, at the end of the day wants to support students and it allows me to do my job in a meaningful way.
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:21.000]   So it has been a wonderful experience to be a part of this team. I am for the renewal. I do want to say like, you know, there hasn't been much teacher turnover since I've started working there.
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:31.000]   And it allows me to build these relationships that are really powerful with teachers. They call me and say, Hey, this student looks like they're upset. Can you meet with them? And I'm able to meet with them that day.
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:41.000]   I get a call from a parent also. Hey, my daughter had a really rough day. She had a hard time getting out of the car. Can you meet with her? I'm able to meet with that kiddo.
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:50.000]   What a unique opportunity to have a school psychologist on call when your kiddo's having a rough day. And if I wasn't available, there'd be other stuff available too.
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:13:04.000]   So it really is one of the more meaningful ways that I'm a part of the team and that El Rancho supports mental health needs of our students and is able to provide a rich environment for them.
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:09.000]   Thank you for your time. And we hope to hear about our renewal.
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:29.000]   Are there any other speakers you don't have to have a blue card? So it is a public hearing if anybody else would like to speak.
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:42.000]   So I was not planning on speaking, but I didn't want to, my name is Jessica Nybarger and I am a history teacher at El Rancho. I just got teacher of the year at El Rancho. I am a teacher.
[03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:53.000]   I am department chair and I just wanted to make sure that you got to hear from a teacher. I have loved being at El Rancho. I feel very supported as a teacher.
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:14:07.000]   One of my favorite things about Michelle and the admin is when I have an idea, they're like, let's try it. I have brought tutorial talks to the school where we have guest speakers from the community come in and talk to the students.
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:21.000]   We just got our textbook adoption and my whole department, they allowed all of us to come together and to pilot and have given us an opportunity to work in the summer to make sure that we are ready to go for the school year.
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:28.000]   Being a part of the department chair meetings, we are constantly asked our input.
[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:36.000]   This year we rolled out new social economic stuff to make sure we are meeting the needs of the students because it is hard to be a seventh grader.
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:51.000]   And I would say this year over every year, I feel like our students are just being more connected to each other and being more connected to the students and this is like whole professional development that was brought in by our admin team.
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:15:02.000]   I know not every school is perfect. I know not every teacher is perfect, but I feel like at El Rancho we are given the opportunity to go out there and to try to be our best.
[03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:17.000]   If you can see that with the test scores, and I promise I did not even plan to be up here, but I just really want you to know how much I love this school and how much I love this staff and how much I really do think the students enjoy being a part of our school.
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:30.000]   And I really do ask for you to consider this seven-year renewal because we have worked so hard to try and just meet the students' needs and I feel that I have been supported by admin all the way.
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:40.000]   So just thank you for your time and, you know, I just, I really hope you can see just how much I love this school even.
[03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:54.000]   And with Jessica Allen too, I am the teacher who will impale her and be like, hey, you know, this year I have a student who was in tears and I could just spot her across the room because she was going through a tough time with her parents.
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:59.000]   Her mom was on a vacation, she was with her dad, I e-mailed and she's being seen in the office.
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:06.000]   Or it's just the students who, you know, are just struggling with different, you know, learning disabilities and stuff.
[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:13.000]   I can e-mail the special ed team and they'll work with me. So it's just a really collaborative school. So thank you.
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:28.000]   Is there anyone else? Going once, going twice? Thank you.
[03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:43.000]   Hey senior, no further speakers on this matter? Public comment for this action item is now closed. Are there any clarifying questions from the board?
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:58.000]   Thank you for being here. For those who don't know, my kids went to a ranch in two and I was a PT president when I was there and so I worked with Michelle and I worked with the previous principal, John Besta.
[03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:08.000]   I wanted to just comment on the atrium and the epoxy and that was so remated because I know there were several times when I felt like I could have slipped on it.
[03:17:08.000 --> 03:17:14.000]   It's really slippery. It's like orange favors. Yeah, so I'm glad to hear that.
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:26.000]   But another thing that is new is the coyote den. Can you tell me more about the coyote den and what it does and how it supports kids?
[03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:47.000]   So during COVID we saw students who were really introverted. They didn't know how to interact with other students. We had students at school part of the time, other students who chose to stay home the entire time.
[03:17:47.000 --> 03:18:06.000]   So our goal was to create a safe space for any of our students to go to whether they're having a hard day. If they need to talk to one of our school psychologists, it is manned by one of the two at lunch.
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:25.000]   Students are able to work in small groups together. They find friends together and so it's really a space for any students who, whether they need to take a break, whether they want to join other classmates,
[03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:43.000]   maybe they're overwhelmed with 1,100 students on campus and just kind of need to connect in a smaller, quieter space. So it's really meant to provide that ongoing support, whether they need it one day a week or five days a week.
[03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:51.000]   Any student can go and feel welcomed and included.
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:58.000]   Thank you. Thank you for the information. I'm actually pretty excited to hear from that.
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:12.000]   I think that's all the questions I have for now, but I hope we have the opportunity to ask questions between now and after we get the reports.
[03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:22.000]   I just wanted to make a comment and thank everybody for coming in to speak. You're very heartfelt. Obviously love your school and we appreciate you coming in.
[03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:38.000]   And we will be getting reports because laws have changed and we haven't had a renewal in a while. So we're going to wait to hear from from them on that, but we do appreciate you coming in. So thank you.
[03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:43.000]   Alright, thank you both for those comments and questions.
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:52.000]   So the process that happens now is we will have an additional board meeting to discuss and approve the charter.
[03:19:52.000 --> 03:20:14.000]   But for now, I will close the public hearing on the El Rancho Charter School renewal and reopen the regular board meeting at 814 p.m. Action on the El Rancho Charter for renewal of its charter will be included at a future Orange Unified School Board meeting agenda.
[03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:42.000]   Thank you. It was a tongue twister. Thank you all for coming tonight and we look forward to reading future reports.
[03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:57.000]   We have been the public hearing initial proposal from Orange Unified School District to Orange Unified Education Association for 2024-2025 contact negotiations.
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:01.000]   And I will refer to Mr. Gonzalez.
[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:06.000]   Who will refer to Ms. Nibb to introduce this item.
[03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:17.000]   This is the first of two items on the board agenda tonight regarding initial contract proposals for negotiations for the 2024-2025 school year with Orange Unified Education Association.
[03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:28.000]   And we have Lexi Davidson from AORR to present on this item for us.
[03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:35.000]   Good evening Board President Page, members of the board, Superintendent Gonzalez, cabinet and the community.
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:49.000]   As Ms. Nibb mentioned, this is the first of two items on the board agenda tonight regarding initial proposals for negotiations for the 2024-2025 school year with the Orange Unified Education Association.
[03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:59.000]   This item is the district's initial contract proposal to OUEA. The second item is OUEA's initial contract proposal to the district.
[03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:06.000]   Each of the initial proposals on the agenda tonight require a public hearing, so we will have two public hearings back to back.
[03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:28.000]   It is recommended that the Board of Education hold a public hearing to receive input on the district's initial proposal to OUEA for the 2024-2025 contract negotiations and to authorize staff to refer to the district's initial proposal to OUEA representatives to begin the negotiations process.
[03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:39.000]   Thank you. The Board of Education will now hold a public hearing to receive input on the district's initial proposal to the Orange Unified Education Association, OUEA, for contract negotiations.
[03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:54.000]   I will now close the regular meeting and open the public hearing at 8.17 p.m. Are there any speakers wishing to address the board?
[03:22:54.000 --> 03:23:08.000]   Okay, hearing none, I will now close the public hearing and reopen the regular board meeting at 8.18 p.m. No action will be taken as this is a public hearing to receive public comment.
[03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:20.000]   Okay, now moving on to 7C, Public Hearing Orange Unified Education Association proposal to Orange Unified School District for 2024-2025 contract negotiations.
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:26.000]   And I will now ask Mr. Gonzalez, who will then transfer to next day.
[03:23:26.000 --> 03:23:29.000]   We're going to go straight to Ms. Davis.
[03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:40.000]   Hello again. This is the second item for the public hearing, which is to present OUEA's initial proposal to the district as part of a board agenda for public hearing.
[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:53.000]   It is therefore recommended that the Board of Education hold a public hearing to receive input on OUEA's initial proposal to the district for the 2024-2025 contract negotiations.
[03:23:53.000 --> 03:24:04.000]   Thank you. The Board of Education will hold a public hearing to receive input on the Orange Unified Education Association's initial proposal to the district for contract negotiations.
[03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:17.000]   I will now close the regular meeting and open the public hearing at 8.19 p.m. Are there any speakers wishing to address the board?
[03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:32.000]   Okay, hearing none, I will now close the public hearing and reopen the regular board meeting at 8.20 p.m. No action will be taken at this time as this is a public hearing to receive public comment.
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:34.000]   Thank you.
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:42.000]   7D Board Governance and Leadership Team Agreements and Protocols.
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:52.000]   Okay, so this item has been an ongoing discussion with Mr. Gonzalez and with our board members.
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:25:06.000]   It was initiated because we had two new board members and as we really haven't had new board members in a while, I think I was the newest board member with Ms. Ramsey when we came in.
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:14.000]   And so to then bring on new board members, this is the governance team handbook that we have.
[03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:29.000]   And so there's not a lot of information that we have to be able to pass over. I know that when Ms. Kathy Moffitt was on the board, she did create a notebook with a lot of information on how to govern, which was very helpful.
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:41.000]   And that's something that we've also considered. But in the recent months, we did have formal governance training to onboard trustee Pelley and trustee Glass.
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:56.000]   A part of that discussion has been essentially questioning our protocols, questioning meaning what are our protocols and I know that depending on, we've heard different variants as I think in the past couple of years.
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:26:08.000]   So this is an opportunity for us to discuss basically also asking if we were to have a governance training and a handbook, what would go in the handbook.
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:20.000]   And so is there anything specific topics that you would like to discuss at a future meeting.
[03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:32.000]   And also the intent of why this is an action item is because I would like to ask the board to create an ad hoc committee. And I would request for my wish list.
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:44.000]   A veteran board member and a new board member to join a committee with consultants to help create a draft handbook to then present to the board at a future time.
[03:26:44.000 --> 03:27:02.000]   No, in fact, I think you did a great job of summarizing, you know, where we've been and and I thought the training that we had for trustee Pelley and trustee Glass was a really great one.
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:19.000]   There's a chance to really kind of understand about board governance and and it really kind of sparked the conversation of, you know, we really would like more governance training and opportunities for the board to discuss with each other about these very important matters.
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:33.000]   But it seems like we always have, you know, full agenda and lots of things to do. And it's always, you know, one of those kind of aspirational things that you never get to. And there's always that next board election around the corner.
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:39.000]   And so I was going to put it off till after that. And then you never quite get to it. So we thought, let's do something now.
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:49.000]   And let's not delay and if there's an opportunity to update and continue governance training after the next board election, then we'll do that too.
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:51.000]   Thank you.
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:28:09.000]   I just make a quick comment on the students. I'm sorry. Many of us have taken classes and governance through CSBA. And I believe even some of us have finished the governance and master's in governance and so, and I think it's really helpful.
[03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:18.000]   But what I think is more helpful is that we do this in public. So all seven, seven of us are on the same page. So we have a good understanding.
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:42.000]   And we know that we're paying attention in class to be honest, right. So I think being that we formalize the process and that we have a discussion here and we have someone we can ask direct questions, because then sometimes these classes, you can't really ask a lot of questions that may be more particular to our situation.
[03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:54.000]   So I highly recommend that we do this and it's important for, I think, for the public to see.
[03:28:54.000 --> 03:29:12.000]   I would just add, I think good governance. When you talk about former trustee Moffat, that was always her big priority. And she really did try to keep our board on that. And when she was president, she brought that forward.
[03:29:12.000 --> 03:29:30.000]   But it really hasn't been a priority of most of the boards that we've had in the probably the past decade. And I do think it's foundational to us doing a good job is that we do have these discussions and what does good governance mean.
[03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:46.000]   How do we trust one another? I mean, when we can talk about what our priorities are and we can tell the public what our priorities are and how we can do that in a relatively civil manner, I think that that's really important.
[03:29:46.000 --> 03:30:02.000]   And especially in light of the last year, it was not a civil environment. And probably all of us at one time or another was guilty of something, not the two new ones, because you weren't here, you were on your couch watching the meetings, I know.
[03:30:02.000 --> 03:30:18.000]   I do think it's just critically important and I'm very grateful to both superintendent and President Page for really making this a priority and for onboarding our new trustees on governance.
[03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:38.000]   I think it's really, really important. And these protocols have been referred to. I've referred to them several times in the last few years, and they really weren't on the front of anyone's mind, like the no surprises rule, things like that, that I think are really crucial.
[03:30:38.000 --> 03:30:51.000]   And so I would be happy to serve on the ad hoc committee if you would like me to, but I do think it's a good idea to have a veteran and a newbie to do that.
[03:30:51.000 --> 03:30:54.000]   Thank you for your comments. Trustee Blas.
[03:30:54.000 --> 03:31:17.000]   Thank you, Madam President. I too would like to serve on the ad hoc committee. I think it's important to prioritize this and I do believe in the consensus element that we should have on this board to dissent, but respectfully, but also to be able to come together and understand the needs of our students, as well as the needs of our faculty and staff.
[03:31:17.000 --> 03:31:24.000]   So I do, if it's appropriate, let the volunteers for the ad hoc committee.
[03:31:24.000 --> 03:31:41.000]   Thank you for volunteering. I do have some ideas of topics that we would discuss and I would love to hear the entire board's input, whether you agree that this is something that we should explore or if it's something that maybe we shouldn't explore.
[03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:58.000]   It's split up between two different categories, the main one being process to attend our role as a board member and our responsibilities. So ongoing discussion and setting vision in the direction and goals for our organization.
[03:31:58.000 --> 03:32:21.000]   So how do we do that? Evaluating the superintendent and this is something that we've been discussing recently about tools, the process and a timeline. Accountability, so setting a governance calendar that outlines when the board will receive reports for general meetings and also on progress towards our own goals.
[03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:38.000]   Fiduciary, integrate all budget reports into the governance calendar process for setting direction for negotiations and role of the board in negotiations and how staff will keep the board informed of the progress.
[03:32:38.000 --> 03:32:55.000]   And then another topic being community engagement and community voice setting committees and the role of the board and participating in outreach. So, for example, attending and speaking at local organizations.
[03:32:55.000 --> 03:33:10.000]   In addition to that, I would also like to propose that we address our meetings, not just closed session and reiterating that items during closed session are confidential.
[03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:22.000]   But the consent agenda, the purpose behind what's on consent and the protocol on pulling an item, the process to request an item to be placed on the agenda.
[03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:31.000]   The process for asking questions about the agenda items in advance of the meeting. So it goes back to what Trustee Erickson said about no surprises.
[03:33:31.000 --> 03:33:37.000]   And something that I've been thinking a lot about is the structure of our meeting.
[03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:48.000]   So, we've had very long meetings and I think orange unified is known to have very long meetings going into the morning hours.
[03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:58.000]   And what can we do where we have an equal balance of getting business done, but also being able to celebrate our students and our staff.
[03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:08.000]   So, if the board is in agreement, I think the committee can explore a lot of these different topics.
[03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:25.000]   And if I can just add one of the discussion items about creating the committee itself is just that we can explore some of these things more in depth, but I don't think the intent is for the committee to come back to the board and just show a document and be done.
[03:34:25.000 --> 03:34:45.000]   I think the idea is to have discussion by the board on the draft handle that comes back and just allows the board to have a more meaningful discussion so that way they're not staring at a blank paper when they're talking about items, but to look at some suggestions and then have some consensus and some agreement at that time.
[03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:59.000]   So, our consultant will work with that committee to put a lot of these suggestions together and then we would schedule a study session meeting where we would have a longer period of time to be able to discuss a lot of these topics.
[03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:22.000]   So, I've heard from Trustee Erickson and Trustee Glass who have volunteered, and I also don't mind participating in the Athlete Committee. So, is there a motion to approve Trustees Erickson, Glass, and myself to approve Trustee Kelly Moose? Is there a second?
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:27.000]   I'll second, since you chose to him. So, is there any discussion?
[03:35:27.000 --> 03:35:32.000]   I'll be an alternate, sorry, an alternate.
[03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:35.000]   An alternate.
[03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:41.000]   Great. Thank you. All in favor?
[03:35:41.000 --> 03:35:45.000]   The motion passes 5-0-2. Thank you.
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:52.000]   Now, item 8A, information discussion item on the Villa Park High School Aquatic Center update.
[03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:54.000]   We have one public comment.
[03:35:54.000 --> 03:35:58.000]   Oh, okay.
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:22.000]   Hello, Board. I knew I wasn't going to be able to address this to the two of our Board members who are Democrat, Democrat if they recall, but I was hoping to be able to look at some of the other Board members that shoved this poll through in a very rushed manner and made very direct promises on costs that at the time felt like they would be
[03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:37.000]   impossible to keep, and, shockingly, they kind of are. I want to make sure that as a Board, you guys are stepping back and not feeling like you're still on that rushed path had long down the hill.
[03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:47.000]   We need to make sure we're doing what's best for the school. If that is still putting in this poll at Villa Park, we want to make sure we're not shooting ourselves in the foot.
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:53.000]   The options of no bleachers, the options of no scoreboard, those are real options.
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:37:01.000]   Those are cute little ways to make it look like we're cutting money because even if we didn't do those, we'd have to turn around and do them afterwards at a higher cost.
[03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:12.000]   So that's just not even realistic, but we might want to step back and look about maybe doing an aquatic center somewhere in Orange Unified School District that could benefit more than just one high school.
[03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:17.000]   And I'm saying this as someone who's kids are probably going to go to Villa Park High School, so I would love to have an aquatic center.
[03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:31.000]   That would be amazing, but the kids who are at the other high schools also deserve an aquatic center, and we don't, unless the school districts claim a lottery and I don't know about it, we don't have the money to do with something like this at all the schools.
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:40.000]   So maybe stepping back and looking at what's going to benefit the school rather than rushing headlong because we've already spent, you know, a little bit of money, we want to just keep going, going, going.
[03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:56.000]   I want to make sure we take a step back and use the rest of our funds as wisely as possible. Thank you.
[03:37:56.000 --> 03:38:00.000]   Thank you. Mr. Gonzalez.
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:11.000]   Yes, Ms. Holguin and her team will be presenting on this item.
[03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:24.000]   Thank you, Superintendent Gonzalez and good evening, Madam President, Trustee, distinguished trustee members and Superintendent Gonzalez, cabinet members and community partners with us here tonight and those joining us virtually.
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:35.000]   Tonight we have an informational presentation to update the board regarding the progress and the discoveries that have been identified during the pre-construction phase of the project.
[03:38:35.000 --> 03:38:52.000]   Before handing it over to our presenters to cover agenda topics, we wanted to start with some milestone to help to help us get us all up to speed as we have new board members and staff that were not part of the team at the start of this project.
[03:38:52.000 --> 03:39:05.000]   Villa Park's pool has exhausted its lifespan. The decision to move forward with the new pool at Villa Park was reached after various presentations were provided by previous staff over the last year or so.
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:13.000]   In October of 2023, the board approved PBK to provide architectural services for the design of the pool.
[03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:21.000]   In December, the board approved the use of the lease-lease back process to finance the pool construction.
[03:39:21.000 --> 03:39:33.000]   At the February 8, 2024 board meeting, the board approved Neff Construction Company to work with PBK to design the plans as part of the pre-construction phase.
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:39.000]   The board also approved the purchase of a Mertha pool, which was a separate agreement.
[03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:54.000]   Since then, PBK, Neff and staff have been working on the design, and tonight we want to inform the board what has been discovered as part of the due diligence phase and provide cost-saving options.
[03:39:54.000 --> 03:40:07.000]   I will now turn it over to Ms. Vasquez, Executive Director of Facilities Development and Planning, who will introduce our presenters tonight.
[03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:21.000]   Thank you, Assistant Superintendent Holkin, good evening, Board President Page, escape members of the board, Superintendent Gonzalez, Executive Staff, Cabinet, and community members.
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:25.000]   I'm pleased to introduce the team presenting this evening.
[03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:43.000]   Our guests are Arina's, our Bruce O, Jose Vallarta, Ariel Mascarinas, from PBK Architects. Additionally, in the audience we have Nick Moro, and Tom Ortonen, and from Neff Construction, who will be available to answer any questions you may have.
[03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:48.000]   We also have Dave Doomey Sr. and Dave Doomey with Mertha Pool.
[03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:57.000]   At this time, I'd like to turn it over to PBK Architects to begin the presentation. Thank you.
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:03.000]   Thank you, Saul. Evening members of the board, my name is Bruce O, I'm the Principal in Charge for this project.
[03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:18.000]   As previously discussed back in December when we were notified to proceed, since then we've met with the staff and the imagery and diagram that you see on the screen as a result of multiple meetings in terms of adjacency.
[03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:24.000]   And since then we've discovered a couple items based on investigations.
[03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:35.000]   Number one, we found that there is a gas main underneath the proposed building. Two, there is also an underground conduit for solar that's underneath the proposed pool locations.
[03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:45.000]   And third, there's a high water table where currently where the location of the project is, and last is also a power connecting the new building up front.
[03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:59.000]   And these various things that we discovered has produced a couple unforeseen costs that Arial will kind of walk you through.
[03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:07.000]   Hi, so my name is Arial. I'm a project manager at PBK and I'm kind of the boots on the ground presence when working on these projects.
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:13.000]   So in the next slide, we're covering the updated estimated projects for us.
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:24.000]   There we go. And as, as mentioned, originally we had presented an estimated project cost back in December at $15.8 million.
[03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:28.000]   This is inclusive of both estimated hard and soft costs.
[03:42:28.000 --> 03:42:36.000]   These costs, like we mentioned before presented in December happened before our due diligence site investigations.
[03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:47.000]   So there are a couple of things that Bruce had briefly mentioned that we had discovered in this process and in the way of, in the way of resolving these issues.
[03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:59.000]   We've noted them as itemized line items, the underground utilities that we had that were unforeseen underneath the underneath the proposed building and pool site.
[03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:04.000]   Can be found in items three and three to seven on the left hand side.
[03:43:04.000 --> 03:43:23.000]   Additional hard costs that we'd identified include the demolition of the existing pool, which includes the asphalt in full that we that was not included in the previous estimated project costs because we had earlier identified it as an item of scope that can be.
[03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:29.000]   Whether we done in a later phase of design or in a separate project altogether.
[03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:41.000]   Also, additional items that we had brought up at the estimated hard costs include constructability items that we had discovered when working with net construction.
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:51.000]   After that, they had joined on and in our, in our constant collaboration with the district. We've also identified the items on the right hand side as estimated.
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:44:01.000]   Project soft cost changes in doing so. We've also outlined an additional costs for escalation at 5%.
[03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:14.000]   And all of these costs of total to an updated kind of costs as almost $4 million for their updated estimated project costs and a total of $19.8 million.
[03:44:14.000 --> 03:44:20.000]   Along with these items of additional required scope.
[03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:36.000]   We've also identified items that are impacting our schedule directly as seen on this diagram in the light gray with the yellow outline. That is the outline of the proposed new site of the pool and pool building.
[03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:52.000]   And as you can see, there is this dash red line running from the North end where the building 500 building is that was identified earlier as one of the underground utilities that we had discovered during our site investigations.
[03:44:52.000 --> 03:45:13.000]   This power conduit that runs underneath our proposed site serves the 500 building and the building and this conduit cannot be relocated and dealt with until the removal of the relocatable buildings.
[03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:24.000]   As shown in the yellow, as well as in gray, we show the relocatable buildings on site. Some of them within the boundaries of our pool and building site.
[03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:33.000]   These buildings must be removed before construction might start on the area of the new pool complex.
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:38.000]   Can I ask you a quick question on that? Is there an additional cost removal of those buildings?
[03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:53.000]   The removal of the buildings is actually not part of this project. It's identified as part of measure S because some of these portables are supporting the construction of the building 500.
[03:45:53.000 --> 03:45:56.000]   Okay, but there is cost associated with removing those.
[03:45:56.000 --> 03:46:02.000]   I believe so. I would have to defer too.
[03:46:02.000 --> 03:46:12.000]   That is correct. That is a separate project that we will move forward once the new building is complete. Thank you.
[03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:24.000]   Right, so the removal of the removal of these relocatable classrooms cannot occur and so occupancy of the 500 building is complete and the construction is complete for that building.
[03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:37.000]   As you can see, those classrooms currently occupy where the new location is completion of the 500 building is slated for November of this year, which is impacting our schedule.
[03:46:37.000 --> 03:46:56.000]   Another item that we wanted to point out was just areas of campus destruction that we've identified as a noise level demolition. Since we've identified the demolition of the existing pool as well as the ball walls that are located within our site boundaries.
[03:46:56.000 --> 03:47:19.000]   Those have to occur first in the demolition phase. It's quite noisy, noisy activity, an activity best slated for summer. And another thing to point out that we wanted to clarify was student access towards the pool and the fields during construction would be limited during the school year as construction takes place.
[03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:30.000]   All of these items impacted show our updated, our updated construction timeline in the gray. You can see our original timeline that we have presented back in December.
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:44.000]   And in the red, we are showing the updated one. We've identified the new classroom building of being completed in November 2024, as well as when we anticipate DSA approval slated for March 2025.
[03:47:44.000 --> 03:48:01.000]   And for resistance to summer construction after the board approves the GMP in the GMP in May 2025. With the completion of the pool and pool building slated for August 2026.
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:13.000]   In, in working with our least space back contractor as well as the district and conversations with the site staff, we've identified areas of cost savings.
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:21.000]   And we've, we've shown two potential options as opportunities for these costs savings.
[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:36.000]   We've identified option A as to relocate the pool and option B to relocate and rotate the pool. Both options choose different, different locations of the pool that have less impacts to them.
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:46.000]   In this first option for relocating the pool, we've shown, we're showing the pool now in the same location as the existing pool.
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:54.000]   And this is, this helps with cost savings because it requires less demolition.
[03:48:54.000 --> 03:49:11.000]   It helps with savings and pool excavation because we're utilizing the depth that's existing there. It helps us bypass a couple of those utility lines such as the SoCal gas make as well as the building 500 power conduit.
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:17.000]   And it ultimately still is impacted by the classrooms to the south side.
[03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:31.000]   But as you can see, this is this option results in a cost savings of nearly half a million dollars and it brings updated estimated project costs, which includes estimated hard and soft costs, 19.2 million.
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:40.000]   In this next option B, we're showing the pool and the site rotated and relocated.
[03:49:40.000 --> 03:49:52.000]   Again, it's capturing the same cost savings items in reduction of asphalt demolition and savings and pool excavation as well as capturing those additional underground utility lines.
[03:49:52.000 --> 03:50:02.000]   Just by rotating the pool, we're able to bypass the solar panel conduit that's running just directly to the south of the site, north of those relocatable classrooms.
[03:50:02.000 --> 03:50:17.000]   We also reducing the amount of retaining walls necessary to kind of meet the flood zone requirements as well as there's no immediate need to remove the relocatable classrooms.
[03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:35.000]   So as you can see, those remain intact on this image provided here. This estimated cost savings for this item is roughly roughly a million dollars and brings an estimated project costs to 18.7 million dollars.
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:47.000]   I just want to clarify, is that moving it from a north south facing pool to an east west facing pool? Yes, this moves it from a north south facing pool to an east west facing pool.
[03:50:47.000 --> 03:51:01.000]   And I did want to kind of be transparent and say in our discussions with the site staff, with the coaches and with the principal, this is the least favorable option for the school as the site proposed to keep the pools originally designed.
[03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:14.000]   Well, also because the sun because it is in in the afternoon is, I know we have that problem at El Medina. So, right, this would this would affect the water problem. Okay.
[03:51:14.000 --> 03:51:20.000]   Additional cost saving measures that we've identified include this list of options.
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:35.000]   One of them was to provide a relocatable classroom in lieu of having having the team room as part of this new pool building complex by by removing the team room and providing a relocatable classroom.
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:48.000]   This, this has cost savings in terms of buildings for a footage and providing a relocatable classroom is a lot cheaper than full construction.
[03:51:48.000 --> 03:51:57.000]   The next option is to remove the shade shelters. We have identified these options based off of items that we can see.
[03:51:57.000 --> 03:52:11.000]   We can see postponed to maybe a later date or things that can be brought in after so removal of the shade shelters would save about $400 million or $400,000 rather.
[03:52:11.000 --> 03:52:20.000]   The removal of sports lighting was another one that we identified in lieu of must go sports lighting kind of a stadium style lighting.
[03:52:20.000 --> 03:52:30.000]   We've pitched the idea for placing it with lighting that's directly mounted surface mounted to the building and providing enough lighting to the pool facility.
[03:52:30.000 --> 03:52:49.000]   And then the fourth option is the removal of the scoreboard if paired with another option to rotate and relocate the building as well as the pool salvaging and actually just using the existing scoreboard in its location is a pretty viable option.
[03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:54.000]   We've also identified the cost savings from reducing the pool deck.
[03:52:54.000 --> 03:53:09.000]   Even reducing it by 20% will save us around $400,000 reducing the pool size to a 38 meter pool will also result in cost savings and this reduction in pool size.
[03:53:09.000 --> 03:53:23.000]   We've talked with our projects designers and it's still the 38 meter pool design will still accommodate kind of the sites need for the water polo and 410 swim lanes during their swim meets.
[03:53:23.000 --> 03:53:29.000]   So this was kind of an option that we were working through as well as the removal of storage.
[03:53:29.000 --> 03:53:44.000]   Currently, we're showing two areas of storage, both at 300 square feet. If we remove three and if we remove one of those areas of storage, the site would still have more than double the storage that they currently have on site.
[03:53:44.000 --> 03:53:59.000]   And the last kind of additional cost saving measure we've identified is the removal of the bleachers, which the site has kind of mentioned the idea of salvaging their own interest.
[03:53:59.000 --> 03:54:11.000]   And this brings us to the end of the presentation. Thank you.
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:18.000]   Are there comments and questions? I'm sure there's money from fellow board members.
[03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:22.000]   Who would like to begin?
[03:54:22.000 --> 03:54:38.000]   Just a quick question about the two options, the A and the B, as it pertains to the of the photo will take conduit. It doesn't mention that in option A. So I'm wondering if the gas line remaining in place includes the photo will take.
[03:54:38.000 --> 03:54:40.000]   It was just not on there.
[03:54:40.000 --> 03:54:56.000]   So, just to clarify the location of the photovoltaic line, actually, the location of the photovoltaic line is actually running south directly north of the relocatable buildings by the south.
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:15.000]   So, the photovoltaic line and the south line, the gas main actually run perpendicular to each other. One of them runs directly east of the relocatable buildings to the northeast side and then the other runs south.
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:30.000]   So by rotating the pool, we're able to avoid all three underground utilities for, I believe, that we've identified, but the photovoltaic line is still running underneath the pool shown in option A.
[03:55:30.000 --> 03:55:36.000]   Thank you.
[03:55:36.000 --> 03:55:39.000]   Thank you.
[03:55:39.000 --> 03:55:56.000]   Disappointment is really an understatement because back here in December, I remember we were asking and drilling and saying what happens about the cost and I feel like the board approved this for under $16 million and now we're facing a situation.
[03:55:56.000 --> 03:56:21.000]   I mean, clearly, these lines did not just appear. It's not like we found dinosaur bones or some ancient artifacts. So, for this to be this off in estimation is really a disappointment because we're already moving down a road and you're going to ask us to make a decision while we're in that road.
[03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:34.000]   And I warned our board back then and I'm really upset because we're like, oh, we're going to keep it under $16 million. We're going to keep it under $16 million and it's $4 million more.
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:46.000]   It's really disappointing and I'm really mad because now we kind of have sort of a commitment, but you know, what do we do? Where do we go from here? I don't know.
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:59.000]   There's so many questions that I have and but I don't even know if it's worth asking at this point.
[03:56:59.000 --> 03:57:22.000]   We have more fees underground utilities taken into consideration. We have plans and so it's not like it's a surprise.
[03:57:22.000 --> 03:57:35.000]   And I wanted to emphasize that all I wanted was accurate estimates back then and transparency. That's all I wanted so we can vote on that and we didn't.
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:44.000]   I just want to clarify that some of the site investigations like I mentioned earlier had occurred after the board meeting that took place in December.
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:58:00.000]   One of those things included underground utility mapping, geotechnical service, underground topographical service, and the underground utility mapping services is what led us to find the four underground utilities.
[03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:04.000]   $4 million is a big difference. Huge difference.
[03:58:04.000 --> 03:58:10.000]   You know, we came back to us and said it was going to be half a million dollars. Maybe I get it, but $4 million is a big difference.
[03:58:10.000 --> 03:58:19.000]   We had an estimate from another architect prior to this and it was like closer to mid-20s and they were let go because they couldn't get it down.
[03:58:19.000 --> 03:58:24.000]   And so they were estimating it in a more accurate way, I guess.
[03:58:24.000 --> 03:58:29.000]   And so for me to see this, it's like it was just really disappointing.
[03:58:29.000 --> 03:58:34.000]   Now you're going to put us in a position where we're going to have to reject it, accept it, and those are our options, right?
[03:58:34.000 --> 03:58:45.000]   I have it in my notes. If the board budgets a certain amount and the proposals are higher, A, or can we accept it? B, we can reject it or go back to your event.
[03:58:45.000 --> 03:58:49.000]   So.
[03:58:49.000 --> 03:58:57.000]   And what I also want to know is the costs that you have right here for $19 million, is that include the MRSA pool?
[03:58:57.000 --> 03:59:03.000]   Okay, I just want to make sure the cost that we presented back in December included the MRSA pool.
[03:59:03.000 --> 03:59:12.000]   I just want to make sure this cost still includes it.
[03:59:12.000 --> 03:59:24.000]   Some of the questions I have is, are the options, you gave us an option for a 38 meter, how much less is it for a 33 meter?
[03:59:24.000 --> 03:59:28.000]   And what happens to our MRSA pool that we already bought?
[03:59:28.000 --> 03:59:39.000]   That's at 50 meter and we reduce it down to 38 or 33.
[03:59:39.000 --> 03:59:53.000]   I had the conversation with representatives from MRSA pool and they've indicated that we would reduce the current purchase order, which is at 1.1 to roughly between 700,000 to 750,000 thereabouts.
[03:59:53.000 --> 04:00:00.000]   So we would not lose our deposit or the funds, we would just reduce the purchase order.
[04:00:00.000 --> 04:00:05.000]   Okay.
[04:00:05.000 --> 04:00:12.000]   I might have more questions because I won't pause them on, you guys can go ahead and ask first and I can come back.
[04:00:12.000 --> 04:00:14.000]   Okay, thank you.
[04:00:14.000 --> 04:00:17.000]   Trustee Kelly.
[04:00:17.000 --> 04:00:21.000]   So, I'm really more curious to hear what you all have to say.
[04:00:21.000 --> 04:00:25.000]   My fellow trustees were the ones who were here and involved in this.
[04:00:25.000 --> 04:00:33.000]   I watched from my couch at home, along with Trustee Glauph, and I had a lot of the same questions.
[04:00:33.000 --> 04:00:40.000]   I think some general statements, yes, it is disappointing, obviously, that it's such a huge cost.
[04:00:40.000 --> 04:00:44.000]   And then I still wonder, that's what we know now, is there going to be more?
[04:00:44.000 --> 04:00:46.000]   Of course, there's going to be more.
[04:00:46.000 --> 04:00:49.000]   Timelines we know with construction, they always get longer.
[04:00:49.000 --> 04:00:59.000]   So now we're 14 months further down the road, it will probably be more, a lot more disruption to Villa Park High School, which we've had with the field ongoing and that kind of thing.
[04:00:59.000 --> 04:01:02.000]   This is just kind of what comes to mind.
[04:01:02.000 --> 04:01:15.000]   And also just the idea that, you know, we can make all these cuts and, you know, I know one of the speakers said earlier that eventually you're going to want a nicer scoreboard or bleachers, those kind of things.
[04:01:15.000 --> 04:01:23.000]   We can make those cuts, but if we're spending a big chunk of money, this needs to be a really nice pool with everything we need.
[04:01:23.000 --> 04:01:27.000]   We shouldn't cut bleachers, we shouldn't cut the pool deck space.
[04:01:27.000 --> 04:01:33.000]   We want to make room for parents to be there and to have a good scoreboard and lighting and all of the things that we know we're going to need.
[04:01:33.000 --> 04:01:35.000]   So if we're going to do it, we need to do it right.
[04:01:35.000 --> 04:01:44.000]   But with this cost, I don't know that that is doing it right because I don't know that we're doing due diligence in being this close to possible.
[04:01:44.000 --> 04:01:50.000]   But again, I'm really curious to hear what the fellow trustees here who were more involved.
[04:01:50.000 --> 04:01:53.000]   I wanted to get my two cents.
[04:01:53.000 --> 04:02:08.000]   What's really disappointing is that we asked these very specific questions about the portables and moving them and aligning it with the 500 building and there were promises made.
[04:02:08.000 --> 04:02:18.000]   In addition to that, I remember asking you about the handball courts and the answer was that there's security issues, so we may as well take them down.
[04:02:18.000 --> 04:02:22.000]   Well, afterwards we find out that Villa Park has a handball team.
[04:02:22.000 --> 04:02:25.000]   So where are they going to practice and handball team? Thank you.
[04:02:25.000 --> 04:02:27.000]   And so where are they going to play?
[04:02:27.000 --> 04:02:36.000]   And it's a group that typically doesn't do other types of scores.
[04:02:36.000 --> 04:02:40.000]   This is what creates their own culture on that campus.
[04:02:40.000 --> 04:02:45.000]   And so we're completely displacing them by removing those that wall.
[04:02:45.000 --> 04:02:56.000]   And so as you were going through this presentation, I kept taking notes of we had these discussions in December and specifically asked like what would happen.
[04:02:56.000 --> 04:02:58.000]   And it's just really disappointing.
[04:02:58.000 --> 04:03:07.000]   And the only question that comes to mind is where you asked to present this at that specific number so that it would be approved.
[04:03:07.000 --> 04:03:11.000]   But if Trustee Erickson has more to say.
[04:03:11.000 --> 04:03:22.000]   I asked whether they were pressured to present it as under 16 million so that it would get approved.
[04:03:22.000 --> 04:03:37.000]   Answer that question. So for the $4 million incurred costs, about 1 million of that is an escalation due to extended construction that was on the foreseen back then that we have no idea that 500 will be completed in November.
[04:03:37.000 --> 04:03:42.000]   Another item in there, the high water table is still technical survey.
[04:03:42.000 --> 04:03:49.000]   We will have to actually pick a point where we want to build in order for them to actually drill a boring in that location.
[04:03:49.000 --> 04:03:55.000]   So we can't just drill all over the campus because the spot in that spot will be totally different.
[04:03:55.000 --> 04:03:56.000]   Well, that's a question I have.
[04:03:56.000 --> 04:04:02.000]   When you relocate, you're going to have to do that again and you may get a different answer, correct?
[04:04:02.000 --> 04:04:12.000]   It could be worse, it could be better, who knows what it's going to be, but you can't predict that when you relocate.
[04:04:12.000 --> 04:04:17.000]   Well, and back in December, remember we talked about this out of yes.
[04:04:17.000 --> 04:04:30.000]   Yes, but I think within the proximity of the building right now within the proximity, I think that it is still good enough reference for us to move forward based on either option.
[04:04:30.000 --> 04:04:36.000]   But yes, if you want to be precise, you probably will have to drill another one just to distribute.
[04:04:36.000 --> 04:04:37.000]   We want to be precise.
[04:04:37.000 --> 04:04:38.000]   Yes.
[04:04:38.000 --> 04:04:44.000]   I remember we did bring it up that the water table was always an issue.
[04:04:44.000 --> 04:04:46.000]   Always an issue.
[04:04:46.000 --> 04:04:51.000]   I asked us to do that ahead of time before we went down this road and we didn't do it.
[04:04:51.000 --> 04:04:55.000]   We still haven't done our due diligence as far as sequence concern.
[04:04:55.000 --> 04:04:58.000]   We never notified the community about it.
[04:04:58.000 --> 04:05:00.000]   We don't know how they're going to react.
[04:05:00.000 --> 04:05:08.000]   What if we go down this road and then we find out that the community is going to be upset about having a 50 meter pool tournaments all weekends.
[04:05:08.000 --> 04:05:10.000]   We still haven't done it.
[04:05:10.000 --> 04:05:13.000]   And this is the cost without DSA.
[04:05:13.000 --> 04:05:16.000]   Yes.
[04:05:16.000 --> 04:05:25.000]   Currently right now, what the board has approved is gets in place to move forward is based on the current plans and nothing has gone to DSA yet.
[04:05:25.000 --> 04:05:35.000]   The board would like to move forward that reconstruction phase, which is part of why we're here in terms of the due diligence to provide the information.
[04:05:35.000 --> 04:05:51.000]   If the board would like for PBK to explore other options and really look into all of those due diligence items that you were stating, and we would bring this item back as an agenda item to be able to then take action.
[04:05:51.000 --> 04:05:59.000]   And then we're going to move forward based on the current and obviously we've identified that there are some other options available based on what has been identified.
[04:05:59.000 --> 04:06:03.000]   And so today is to provide that information, but we would be more than happy to that.
[04:06:03.000 --> 04:06:13.000]   I'd be more than happy to work with the staff and make sure that they do all of that due diligence to bring back all of that information where they are looking at those options based on all of that information.
[04:06:13.000 --> 04:06:31.000]   And then we're going to move forward based on that information, but we would be more than happy to do all of that due diligence to provide the information, but we would be more than happy to do all of that due diligence to provide the information, but we would be more than happy to do all of that due diligence to provide the information.
[04:06:31.000 --> 04:06:48.000]   We knew it. And we knew it based on prior experience with Willow Park High School and also prior experience with projects that some board members wanted to have done and they wanted to push it through and it always ends up being more, always.
[04:06:48.000 --> 04:06:52.000]   We have the exact same issue with the El Medina High School pool.
[04:06:52.000 --> 04:07:06.000]   Same thing. This is not your problem, but just for purposes. I mean, none of you are here, not letting you, but this is what happens. And we learned a lot from that process because what happened was, you were told a certain price, it ended up being double that price.
[04:07:06.000 --> 04:07:10.000]   And that was when cost saving measures were taken without board approval.
[04:07:10.000 --> 04:07:18.000]   So I do appreciate that you're actually here telling us, talking to us and being transparent with the public about it because that's really important.
[04:07:18.000 --> 04:07:34.000]   What we found at El Medina is they did decrease deck space. They did end up moving it and it was an east-west configuration, which is a nightmare because when you're playing water polo, the sun is in your eyes.
[04:07:34.000 --> 04:07:45.000]   The bleachers are not in the right place. There's all sorts of problems because none of the stuff was brought to the board because we wanted to keep the price down, but we didn't actually approve it.
[04:07:45.000 --> 04:07:51.000]   But it still was double the price because that was a project people wanted to get through.
[04:07:51.000 --> 04:07:57.000]   So I appreciate that it's here and I appreciate that we have options to cut the cost.
[04:07:57.000 --> 04:08:03.000]   Under no circumstances, though, do I think that we should cut deck space for a pool?
[04:08:03.000 --> 04:08:11.000]   I don't think that we should cut the scoreboard or cut bleachers because all of that is fake savings because we're going to do it eventually.
[04:08:11.000 --> 04:08:16.000]   You're not going to have a pool that doesn't have bleachers and shade and a scoreboard.
[04:08:16.000 --> 04:08:25.000]   So while I appreciate it in the short term being cost savings, it's not long term savings.
[04:08:25.000 --> 04:08:40.000]   So to me, and I've asked this question before, I asked this question for El Medina, the only requirement for CIF men's water polo final is that the pool be 33 meters.
[04:08:40.000 --> 04:08:47.000]   That would be so that we could host a CIF final men's water polo tournament.
[04:08:47.000 --> 04:08:51.000]   Other than that, a 25 meter pool is fine.
[04:08:51.000 --> 04:09:03.000]   I personally don't think we should ever put in anything less than 43 meters because I think we should accommodate and have these be whatever current standards are appropriate.
[04:09:03.000 --> 04:09:13.000]   But my question is if we change it to 33 meter, what is the cost savings for 33 meter and how much less deck space do we need?
[04:09:13.000 --> 04:09:18.000]   How much less energy do we have to pay for in a 33 meter pool?
[04:09:18.000 --> 04:09:27.000]   Can we fit a 33 meter pool in the space that we have so that we don't have to redo the geological studies and all of those sorts of things?
[04:09:27.000 --> 04:09:44.000]   Part of the whole idea was that it was going to be located in the place that it's currently located because we were going to be building it at the same time that Willow Park could be using their old pool and then the new pool would be done and then we could get rid of the old pool.
[04:09:44.000 --> 04:09:45.000]   Well, that is gone.
[04:09:45.000 --> 04:09:48.000]   That's off the table because we obviously can't do that.
[04:09:48.000 --> 04:09:54.000]   So there were a lot of things that were sort of justifying the way that this was shoved through that don't apply today.
[04:09:54.000 --> 04:10:05.000]   So I think that we really do need to go back to the drawing board and see what we can do with a smaller pool.
[04:10:05.000 --> 04:10:12.000]   It needs to happen and we need to have it the state of the art so it's going to have the best deck space.
[04:10:12.000 --> 04:10:18.000]   It's going to have the best scoreboards and bleachers and it's going to be a great place that should be configured in the right direction.
[04:10:18.000 --> 04:10:32.000]   We should make sure that, you know, dining blocks are in the right spot. All of the mistakes that were made with Almedina, we need to learn from and we need to make this the best it can be, but it has to be affordable because this is not going to end up being $20 million.
[04:10:32.000 --> 04:10:37.000]   It's going to end up being $25 million, which is what the original estimation was in the first place.
[04:10:37.000 --> 04:10:53.000]   I would like to even go a step further and explore all of our options. Even if it means stopping this pool and renovating it, all three of the other schools as well, because we know that their pools are also not functioning.
[04:10:53.000 --> 04:11:09.000]   And then possibly, you know, in the future, we could consider putting a 50-meter pool or something at a different site so we can start fresh there. So all schools can enjoy it and all kids can enjoy it from all of our schools.
[04:11:09.000 --> 04:11:29.000]   Also, I mean, I'd like to know, like, how does it change what we need for changing rooms and restrooms and all of those associated costs because as the aquatic center gets bigger, so do the requirements from DSA, right, for all sorts of things, like restrooms and things like that.
[04:11:29.000 --> 04:11:41.000]   The larger we grow, the more it is required. So I want to know what is the cost if we shrink? What other things can be cut down while not cutting down on quality? Because I don't want to cut down on quality.
[04:11:41.000 --> 04:11:50.000]   I want to cut down on cost and keep the quality. So how do we do that? And that's what we need to find out.
[04:11:50.000 --> 04:11:59.000]   So I'll work with staff and we'll bring back those options and bring it back as an agenda item to do our due diligence and bringing back some responses to all those questions.
[04:11:59.000 --> 04:12:11.000]   I just want to remind everyone that we are here to make sure that all of our resources are used wisely. We are here to protect our budget. We're here to save our taxpayers money.
[04:12:11.000 --> 04:12:32.000]   And so these are why we're asking these questions because we asked them in December and now we have to ask them again. So this is why we're doing it. And I apologize because I know some of you weren't here back then and certainly some of our board members aren't here, but now we have to just, I don't know, reset.
[04:12:32.000 --> 04:12:52.000]   I do think it's really important to remember that our facility's budget is limited. How much money we have is limited. So when we spend an extra $4 million on a pool that's going to be used by 300 students out of a 27,000 student district, that's $4 million that can't be spent on an elementary school campus.
[04:12:52.000 --> 04:13:03.000]   That's $4 million that can't be used on something. I mean, we all have pools. We all love the idea of having a fantastic pool, but we have to work within the budget and the money that we have.
[04:13:03.000 --> 04:13:16.000]   And we have so many more needs in this district than just a swimming pool. And we're literally spending every dime we have left right now that exists on this pool. And that makes no sense.
[04:13:16.000 --> 04:13:30.000]   And again, I'm going to reiterate that they were matching funds from Fred Kelly Stadium and we had said that they would be used at the middle on the elementary schools.
[04:13:30.000 --> 04:13:39.000]   We will take all of that feedback and come back to you with the options. We wanted to make sure though to present this to you as part before we took any steps and move further with it. So thank you.
[04:13:39.000 --> 04:13:53.000]   I think it might be wise to just go over this one more time to make sure that when we bring this information back, it wasn't something that we heard from one board member and not all.
[04:13:53.000 --> 04:13:59.000]   So I want to make sure that you have your direction clear on what you're going to bring back.
[04:13:59.000 --> 04:14:15.000]   So I heard 33 meter. Don't reduce deck size. Don't reduce shade structure scoreboard.
[04:14:15.000 --> 04:14:30.000]   I think the lighting I think was important. I think everything in the plan we shouldn't reduce our plan should reflect what would benefit students for decades to come, not what can open a pool in a year or two.
[04:14:30.000 --> 04:14:44.000]   Yeah, I want I just want to make sure that when they come back with the information that's like, well, we did mention this one thing and I didn't see you do that. So I want to be absolutely clear on the work that they're going to do to bring back.
[04:14:44.000 --> 04:14:59.000]   And then this idea of this, the 33 meter in terms of position, because everybody here know what the position of the pool is, whether or not it's there on the where the existing pool is or any other.
[04:14:59.000 --> 04:15:08.000]   Do we know where the place is worth being placed based on the input from the board right now.
[04:15:08.000 --> 04:15:15.000]   Because that may make a difference in terms of where what lines we're avoiding and what we're not.
[04:15:15.000 --> 04:15:21.000]   Just to clarify, we were visiting the 33 meter pool in the original location.
[04:15:21.000 --> 04:15:32.000]   I think that's the question is if we have a 33 or even a 38 meter pool, if it's a smaller pool, what are the options for location.
[04:15:32.000 --> 04:15:43.000]   So it sounds like there are various options of either keeping it in the location at a 33 and 38 meter or moving it to one of these locations.
[04:15:43.000 --> 04:15:52.000]   But the direction of the pool stays.
[04:15:52.000 --> 04:16:07.000]   Sorry, can we also just have more information because we have more new board members who may not have received prior information about other options as well.
[04:16:07.000 --> 04:16:12.000]   Like, doing the original renovation of all three poles.
[04:16:12.000 --> 04:16:33.000]   That's what I wanted to make sure of and then in terms of time and money to go back and check that because we did do some study at that time and we got some numbers.
[04:16:33.000 --> 04:16:45.000]   So do you want just those numbers but with escalation or do you want them to be to redo that evaluation.
[04:16:45.000 --> 04:16:49.000]   We could just bring back as much as possible.
[04:16:49.000 --> 04:16:51.000]   Well, that would be to go back and reevaluate.
[04:16:51.000 --> 04:16:58.000]   Because what I want to say is just I want to make sure we have everything on the table so that we can make.
[04:16:58.000 --> 04:17:07.000]   Yes, and I want to make sure that this team brings back the information that you want. So there's options with that we can bring back the same information that was presented before.
[04:17:07.000 --> 04:17:18.000]   Because we think that the pools are in about the same shape and then and then we can ask them to just add escalators in terms of costs from then until now.
[04:17:18.000 --> 04:17:27.000]   Or we can go back and reevaluate the poles which would be contracting the service to do all of that over again and bring that.
[04:17:27.000 --> 04:17:29.000]   Well, it was done about a year ago.
[04:17:29.000 --> 04:17:37.000]   Right. So I just want to make sure we could probably do either one but obviously we want to be more timely and a little bit more efficient in time.
[04:17:37.000 --> 04:17:43.000]   Or you can look at what the team brings back on the 33 meter before making that decision.
[04:17:43.000 --> 04:17:55.000]   Since we're also putting this off a little while, can we put the Mertha on hold right now until we make a decision on size?
[04:17:55.000 --> 04:18:02.000]   Because I don't want them to keep constructing it and then it becomes too late for us to order a different size.
[04:18:02.000 --> 04:18:05.000]   Right back and I construct until we receive DSA approval.
[04:18:05.000 --> 04:18:06.000]   Oh, okay. Everyone.
[04:18:06.000 --> 04:18:07.000]   Thank you.
[04:18:07.000 --> 04:18:13.000]   So if we cancel the pool, we would just be losing our deposit at this point.
[04:18:13.000 --> 04:18:14.000]   That is correct.
[04:18:14.000 --> 04:18:19.000]   What was the deposit at 220,000.
[04:18:19.000 --> 04:18:30.000]   And then the last thing just in terms of if that pool gets moved over significantly, I think trustee Erickson asked if there needs to be a new testing of the space.
[04:18:30.000 --> 04:18:37.000]   I think we can look at it as the soil. So if we are looking at that other space, then we potentially could look at the soils as well.
[04:18:37.000 --> 04:18:38.000]   Okay.
[04:18:38.000 --> 04:18:43.000]   Oh, and then Sequa, we talked about Sequa in the Notifying Vault Arts neighborhood.
[04:18:43.000 --> 04:18:50.000]   We didn't do our, we didn't go out to the public.
[04:18:50.000 --> 04:18:52.000]   Ms. Leskis, can you give us some more information on this?
[04:18:52.000 --> 04:18:56.000]   Because I did see Sequa on the presentation and that's a dollar amount there as well.
[04:18:56.000 --> 04:19:03.000]   Before you tonight is a recommendation to approve a Sequa consultant place works.
[04:19:03.000 --> 04:19:08.000]   They've done, they actually did the Sequa analysis for the new building.
[04:19:08.000 --> 04:19:15.000]   And so with the approval of their contract, we can move forward and do that notification and public comment.
[04:19:15.000 --> 04:19:34.000]   It makes more sense to wait and get an idea and the same thing is going out into the community and advising them and getting input.
[04:19:34.000 --> 04:19:37.000]   Is it the exact same thing or Sequa a different process?
[04:19:37.000 --> 04:19:47.000]   Sequa is that California Environmental Quality Act requirement for all lead agencies to evaluate all projects for any environmental impact.
[04:19:47.000 --> 04:19:51.000]   This construction of the pool would require that analysis.
[04:19:51.000 --> 04:19:56.000]   There's different types of level of environmental analysis based on the scope.
[04:19:56.000 --> 04:20:06.000]   So you have a notice of exemption, which basically qualifies there's qualifications that allow you to file that that still gets circulated for 30 days and gets published.
[04:20:06.000 --> 04:20:13.000]   And basically you're indicating to the community that there is no environmental impact for that specific project.
[04:20:13.000 --> 04:20:20.000]   There's another level called a mitigate negative debt that also can identify some mitigation measures.
[04:20:20.000 --> 04:20:30.000]   They are typically minor as opposed to an environmental impact report, which is the highest level of impact to a community or environment.
[04:20:30.000 --> 04:20:37.000]   Those also indicate high level of mitigation measures to that report.
[04:20:37.000 --> 04:20:47.000]   So this would go through that analysis and the Sequa consultant will determine what type of report would be generated based on the scope of work.
[04:20:47.000 --> 04:20:56.000]   And Ms. Vasquez, based on what you hear in terms of the board's interest in exploring these different options.
[04:20:56.000 --> 04:21:10.000]   Is it your recommendation then that we go through with that approval still on that contract for the Sequa or is it better to hold off to understand the new scope or change in plans before going forward with that?
[04:21:10.000 --> 04:21:22.000]   I think we do have the opportunity to put it on hold. However, if we do do the project, we would still need any environmental analysis.
[04:21:22.000 --> 04:21:32.000]   So why don't we just hold off until we get the new plans back and because I don't see a reason we do have the time to hold.
[04:21:32.000 --> 04:21:35.000]   Well, they wouldn't start it until they knew the scope of the project anyway.
[04:21:35.000 --> 04:21:39.000]   It doesn't really matter even if we approve it tonight and the things going to happen.
[04:21:39.000 --> 04:21:44.000]   I would not release them to do any work at this point.
[04:21:44.000 --> 04:21:57.000]   I do have some questions, but they're so detailed that I'll probably email them and just make sure that you include them in the report.
[04:21:57.000 --> 04:22:10.000]   So thank you, superintendent Gonzalez for helping clarify that. One more clarification I did hear of also coming back with just what it would cost to repair them based on the state of the pools of how they are, all of our pools.
[04:22:10.000 --> 04:22:11.000]   That was an additional report.
[04:22:11.000 --> 04:22:19.000]   We had a report done about a year ago and I did talk about that. So we can just bring that back and just.
[04:22:19.000 --> 04:22:28.000]   I think what we may do is staff is maybe just review that to see if it is something that can be updated as is or if we need to go back into that again.
[04:22:28.000 --> 04:22:37.000]   So maybe we can have some of the stuff that may have not been here during that time to take a look at that and maybe make that recommendation.
[04:22:37.000 --> 04:22:49.000]   I think it's really important to have that information, but I will say that I would tend not to want to just refurbish the 25-meter pools. I mean, I'll just put it out there. I think that those really are outdated.
[04:22:49.000 --> 04:22:52.000]   But I think it's important to have all that information on the table.
[04:22:52.000 --> 04:23:02.000]   I think it may be useful also to the board to understand that we're not redoing all the pools right now. So if you need to take a look again to see.
[04:23:02.000 --> 04:23:12.000]   What state of disreport and repair the other schools pools are that that might be useful to refresh that analysis.
[04:23:12.000 --> 04:23:24.000]   Okay, so I think you have clear direction. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. And thank you. And again, sorry, none of you were here and getting the brunt of it. And I know it's not.
[04:23:24.000 --> 04:23:33.000]   Thank you.
[04:23:33.000 --> 04:23:43.000]   Next on our agenda, we have consent items and items are acted upon one motion. However, any such item can be considered separately at a board members request.
[04:23:43.000 --> 04:23:57.000]   I will be active on following the approval of the consent items. Are there any items that you need to pull?
[04:23:57.000 --> 04:24:05.000]   If not, is there a motion to approve all consent items? Just one second. We were going to pull the sequel item, right?
[04:24:05.000 --> 04:24:11.000]   No, we don't need to. We don't need to pull it. That's right, because it's not going to go forward. Okay.
[04:24:11.000 --> 04:24:14.000]   Thank you, trustee glasses. There a second.
[04:24:14.000 --> 04:24:20.000]   I'll second. Thank you, trustee Erickson. Any discussion?
[04:24:20.000 --> 04:24:23.000]   No. Okay. All in favor.
[04:24:23.000 --> 04:24:25.000]   Okay.
[04:24:25.000 --> 04:24:34.000]   Motion passes five, zero, two.
[04:24:34.000 --> 04:24:37.000]   We already did public comment.
[04:24:37.000 --> 04:24:47.000]   And now 18 other business. Are there any additional comments from board or staff?
[04:24:47.000 --> 04:24:59.000]   I think the only thing I wanted to add and ask superintendent Gonzalez is to request additional information and potentially an investigation on the I nine.
[04:24:59.000 --> 04:25:16.000]   I had made a note of that. So we're going to check on that because we need to look at, you know, doing use of our facilities and any kind of related regulation laws around the school. We'll do that.
[04:25:16.000 --> 04:25:18.000]   Thank you.
[04:25:18.000 --> 04:25:33.000]   We are returning back to closed session. Although the last item that we have in closed session is not does not require a vote.
[04:25:33.000 --> 04:25:40.000]   And there's nothing really additional to that to report out, but we do need to come back to close.
[04:25:40.000 --> 04:25:47.000]   So we will adjourn to a closed session at nine 20.
[04:25:47.000 --> 04:25:49.000]   Thank you.
