and public schools across California are considered essential services. Sporting events will continue at this time but with no
spectators. We beleive that the CIF will cancel sporting events in the near future. This is a very evolving situation and could change.
Currently, our schools are open, but we are ready, if the need is to close, we will move to online/remote learning. Our employees are
working towards that with our staff, our teachers, our principals. We will be providing nutrition services to our most needy and have
