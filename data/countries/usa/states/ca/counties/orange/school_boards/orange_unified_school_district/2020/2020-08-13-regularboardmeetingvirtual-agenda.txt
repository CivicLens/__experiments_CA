OR SHORT-TERM WAIVER

Meeting :

Category :

12. CONSENT ITEMS - HUMAN RESOURCES

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover
assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact.

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the Teacher Assignment/Consent Report as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Individual school districts are responsible to provide their respective county superintendent of schools with
evidence of legal and appropriate assignments for all certificated employees. Legal and appropriate assignments for certificated
employees are those based upon the authorization(s) contained on the specific certificate(s) held by the certificated employee,
as well as additional assignments which are authorized assignment options by the Education Code.
Most of the assignment options provided by the Education Code allow a teacher to serve in an additional assignment, provided
that the teacher has received a specified level of training relative to the subject area to be taught, that the teacher consents to
the assignment, and that the local governing board takes action on the assignment. These assignment options are typically
employed in middle schools and high schools where the teacher is assigned to instruct groups of students in a specific subject
matter area or areas.
The teachers/assignments listed on the attached Teacher Assignment/Consent Report reflect legal and appropriate assignments
based upon authorized assignment options in the Education Code where the teacher has met all requirements and has
consented to the assignment.

physics as a many sided human activity, though a mathematical framework. The material is presented through a wide variety of
different media, including textbooks, laboratory work, and computer applications. Topics include: motion and forces, conservation
of energy and momentum, heat and thermodynamics, waves, and electric and magnetic phenomena. This course will make
connections to the Agriscience CTE pathway, which further supports the goal of physics - to gain a deeper understanding of the
world in which we live.
This course meets the UC d requirement.
BIOTECHNOLOGY I (CTE)
The Biotechnology pathway fuses academic and technical training to prepare students to work in the growing biotechnology
industry. The focus of Biotechnology I is on mastery of basic standard operating procedures in a laboratory. Record-keeping,
safety and proper use of equipment and employee etiquette are stressed. Students learn sterile technique, cell culture, DNA and
protein isolation and electrophoresis. As students continue through the year, they build on the skills developed in the Fall with
emphasis on assay development, spectrophotometry, recombinant DNA technology and bacterial transformation.

ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
This course focuses on collecting, analyzing and reporting data collected in the field. The goal is to provide hands-on experience
in ecological fieldwork and scientific inquiry. This data will be relevant and can be used as part of citizen science data. Citizen
science allows the public to understand the environment and the scientific processes within it.The students participating in this
program will learn a variety of field techniques for restoration and wildlife monitoring through scientific methodology and
interacting with native and invasive plant populations. In addition to the field techniques, it is also expected to relate field data to
ecological processes by recording the data gathered in the field. Experienced Biologists will guide the students through the
techniques with oversight where they will have a chance to ask questions. The students will develop their own statistical and
actual analysis of data.
This course meets UC d requirement.
ENGINEERING CAPSTONE (CTE)
The Capstone class is an engineering research course in which students work in teams to research, design and construct
solutions to open-ended engineering problems. Students in engineering teams will apply technology, science and mathematics
concepts and utilize principles developed in their proceeding courses to solve engineering design problems and develop
innovative designs. Students will research, develop, test, and analyze engineering designs using criteria such as design
effectiveness, public safety, human factors, and ethics. This course is an essential experience for students who are interested in
technology, innovation, design, and engineering.
PRE-AP BIOLOGY
Pre-AP Biology sparks student motivation and critical thinking about our living world as they engage in real-world data analysis
and problem solving. The Pre-AP Biology course emphasizes the integration of content with science practicespowerful reasoning
tools that support students in analyzing the natural world around them. Having this ability is one of the hallmarks of scientific
literacy and is critical for numerous college and career endeavors in science and the social sciences.The Pre-AP areas of focus

are vertically aligned to the science practices embedded in other science courses in high school, including AP, and in college,

essential for their future coursework.Texts take center stage in the Pre-AP English 1 classroom, inspiring and preparing all
students for close, critical reading and analytical writing. The course trains the reader to observe the small details in a text to
arrive at a deeper understanding of the whole. It also trains the writer to focus on crafting complex sentences, building this
foundational skill en route to more sophisticated, longer-form analyses.The Pre-AP English areas of focus are practices that
students develop and leverage as they engage with content. These areas of focus are vertically aligned to the practices
embedded in other English courses in high school, including AP, and in college, giving students multiple opportunities to
strengthen and deepen their work with these skills throughout their educational career. These areas of focus help to identify and
prioritize the practices that are so fundamental to the study of English that they occur consistently throughout the full course of

DESCRIPTION: In 2013, Californias accountability system significantly changed. The California Dashboard contains state
indicators and standards to help identify a schools strengths, weaknesses, and areas in need of improvement. Because these
state indicators and standards were developed for traditional (non-alternative) schools, the State Board of Education and
stakeholders raised concerns that the state indicators and standards did not fairly evaluate the success or progress of alternative
schools that serve high-risk students. Due to this, alternative schools can apply for Dashboard Alternative School Status (DASS).
As a special education school for students of moderate to severe disabilities, Canyon Hills meets the DASS criteria as
determined by the California Department of Education.
