Category :

12. CONSENT ITEMS - HUMAN RESOURCES

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover
assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact.

DESCRIPTION:Textbooks and supplementary instructional texts are reviewed by teacher committees from respective grade
levels or departments, which screen available texts and materials for potential adoption. The selection committee submits its
recommendations to the District Curriculum Council for review and consideration. The District Curriculum Council (DCC) is made
up of representative teachers from elementary, middle and high school. In addition, there are site administrators from all school
levels and central office administrators on the Council. The DCC is an advisory council which addresses universal and specific
issues that either directly or indirectly impact the curriculums offered in the Orange USD schools. The Council will make
recommendations to the Superintendent and Board of Education after thoroughly researching and discussing each issue and
potential impact on student achievement. Texts for CTE courses are previously approved by the Central County ROP/Career
Technical Education Partnership (CTEp).
It is at this juncture that the Board of Education places the texts and/or supplementary texts on "30-day review period" so
members from the public may have an opportunity to review those texts, pending formal adoption. The texts are available for
review at the District Office in the Office of Curriculum and Instruction, Building D. After the 30-day review period, the Board of
Education may take formal action to adopt the textbooks and/or supplementary texts.
