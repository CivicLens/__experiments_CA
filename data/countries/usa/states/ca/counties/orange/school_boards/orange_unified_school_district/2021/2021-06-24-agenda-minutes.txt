4. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Hansen thanked staff for all their hard work with the Facility Master Plan. She stated that in tonight's study session we hope to
complete a process of almost 2 years and gather final input and comments before bringing it back for a vote next month.
She also read a statement from Mr. Howard with the highlights of the season in athletics. Orange Unified lead the way of bringing
sports back. Orange Unified was one of the first districts to open up for sports and brought sports back for conditioning as early as
last summer.
This year, 3055 Orange Unified athletes brought home 25 league championships, 6 CIF finalists, and 6 CIF Championships.
There was also an update about the new El Modena pool supported with photo's. The El Modena Pool Project is moving along very
smoothly, and the project remains on time and on budget. Structural work has been ongoing since May, when the plumbing work
was completed. With the foundation now in place for the planned facilities, including concrete for the pool surface and locker room
footings, the real building will soon begin. The contractor has been extremely diligent, and we are excited to share that the facility is
set to open for El Modena students use in March 2022.
Dr. Hansen thanked Nancy Clark, the Executive Assistant to the Board of Education and the Superintendent, who will be retiring at
the end of June. Nancy has been with Orange Unified for almost 30 years, and she is looking forward to spending time with her
family. Board President Kathy Moffat added that she enjoyed working with Nancy because she understands and appreciates the
mission of schools and what parents and students need from our schools.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Board President Kathy Moffat recognized that this school year has been unusual and challenging. Currently, a robust program for
summer school is being offered at all levels, but we hardly ever get to see how students relate to the program. A video is shown of a
