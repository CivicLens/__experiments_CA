to the 20-minute rule for public comments on non-agenda items.
Trustee Erickson mentioned Mr. Ledesma has always let people speak. She believes this needs to be discussed and agendized and should
not be decided by the president alone. Mr. Ledesma said we can agendize but for this meeting, he would like to shorten the speaking
time. Ms. Erickson would like to give the public a heads-up. Mr. Ledesma stated this is still the consensus of the board.
Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Trustee Miner mentioned that after hearing the Canyon High School students at the last board meeting about the styrofoam trays,
acting principal McKee set up a meeting between Ms. Sanchez, Director of Nutrition Services, and the students. During the meeting, they
were able to convince Ms. Sanchez to switch trays. Ms. Sanchez explained to the girls that they already have a large supply of Styrofoam
trays but once those are used up, they will replace them with a different type of tray. Trustee Miner is working with Villa Park
Councilwoman Crystal Miles, the OC Sheriffs, Supervisor Wagner’s office, and Villa Park High School’s principal Mr. McCuistion on details
to partner with the City of Villa Park to host a town hall meeting on fentanyl in early fall. This town hall will be informative, educational,
and an important tool to educate the community on fentanyl and the dangers youth are facing. She also mentioned that it was great to
see excited students at the McPherson STEM competition.
Trustee Rumsey congratulated all the students that are promoting and graduating but for this report, she focussed on the Student
Board Members. She thanked Madison for representing Canyon High School and for always being energetic and excited. She called Ruby
from El Modena High School a natural leader who is always prepared, articulated, and with a Passion for her school. Jaida and Jay'da
represented Richland very well and Trustee Rumsey thanked them for speaking about their school with pride. Diego represented Orange
High School very well. He is very articulated, can respond to things on the fly, and has a desire to promote school and be part of the
community. Hope from Villa Park High School listened, learned, and brought updates with comic relief to the meeting and with a very
calming presence. She wished staff and students a restful summer.
Trustee Yamasaki enjoyed attending activities. She congratulated Canyon High School baseball which has a State Championship game
coming up. She mentioned the STEM competition between McPherson, Portola, Jordan, and West Orange schools where students had to
solve real-world simulations. She thanked the Youth Center of Orange for recognizing fourth, fifth, and six grade students of six Orange
Unified schools for their leadership and excellence in academics and for demonstrating good character judgment. She also thanked
community partner Orange Home Grown Farmers and Artisan Market, along with many organizations for supporting our students in the
youth food literacy programs that students participated in. She enjoyed the boat races at Canyon High School in which students
competed in self-made boats constructed from cardboard and duct tape. Trustee Yamasaki attended the retiree celebration and she
thanked the retirees for their many years of service. She also attended Mike Short's event for his retirement. Mr. Short is the Choral
Music Director at Orange High School and is very committed to the school and the community. Many schools and the Orange Unified
trustees participated in the May Parade in the City of Orange. It was a great event. She attended the Orange City Council meeting where
Palmyra Elementary received a proclamation for its 70th anniversary. She visited the Jeanne Carter Nature Center during an elementary

drama group. She mentioned that the Orange Unified Art Exhibition was phenomenal. Trustee Erickson enjoyed attending the Youth
Center of Orange event along with Trustees Yamasaki and Rumsey as well as Supervisor Wagner, Orange Mayor Slater, and the Chief of
Police. It was nice to see the future leaders of Orange and all that they've done to earn their character awards and academic awards. She
congratulated the retirees of Orange Unified and thanked them for being an incredible part of the district. The Orange High School Early
College Academy is a program that allows students to attend college while on their high school campus with the highest percentage of
enrolled students taking college courses. The celebration was amazing. She specifically mentioned Dr. Joe Erven, Executive Director of
Innovation and Excellence who is leaving the district. Mr. Erven has brought so many innovative programs to the district like the Verizon
Innovative Learning grant that brought equity and resources. This $5 million dollar grant connected families that can't afford access and

the district offices and the different departments, as well as visit each other's schools to learn about other campuses.
Trustee Ortega recognized Orange City Counsel member Denis Bilodeau who is in attendance. He also mentioned the Early College
Academy banquet held at Santiago Canyon College. It is a huge accomplishment to take both high school and college classes at the same
time, and students and parents should be so proud. Trustee Ortega stated that we are here tonight to hear about the successes and
accomplishments of the students in our district and it saddens him to hear that OUEA president Goodlander called board members
enemies. We all need to work together for the good of the students and the parents. The great majority of the teachers are doing a good
job teaching our students but the union leadership is being divisive. Trustee Ortega stated that the board majority is focused on honoring
parents' rights, making the right decisions for the students, and keeping them safe and focused on education. He thanked the student
board members for spending time with the board members.

very comfortable environment for the student trustees.

item and non­agenda items that are within the Board's subject matter and jurisdiction. Speaking time is limited to three (3) minutes per
speaker with a maximum of twenty(20) minutes per topic. Persons wishing to speak should submit a Public Comment card prior to the
meeting. Non-agenda items may neither be acted upon nor discussed by the Board, but will be responded to either by telephone, mail, or
at a subsequent meeting.
There will be a discussion on the order and time for public comments at the next meeting.
Elisa Kim: why was the superintendent fired? SBAC scores were low. Test scores matter.
Eddie Kim: thanks the teacher in the district. Unions have taken control. The former superintendent did a subpar job.
Frank Rodriguez: evaluate departments. Enrollment and staffing are a problem. Get kids to school. The transportation department has
staffing problems staffing. On agenda: marketing plan to attract drivers.
Linda Cone: is a member of a Statewide Coalition supporting AB1314. It requires schools to notify parents when their students identify as
a different gender.
Lorrie Kaylor: pay careful attention to the wellness spaces at the schools. No to recall.
Dave Johnson: is available for prayers.
Ken Wood: these days education in the state and OUSD is different than back in the day. Not the same values. Madison has those values.
OUEA is promoting a far-left agenda. No recall.
Michelle Morgan: concerned about education in Orange County. Don't groom children. Go back to math, science, and American history. No
recall.
Daniel Shoppe: Dr. Hansen knew about the Crescent elementary teacher and Canyon High School wrestling coach who pleaded guilty to
child pornography. How long did she know? No recall.
Bill Klovistad: please stop name-calling trustee Miner. Give her a chance to do the job she was voted to do. Stop recall.
Mary Heron: great concern about the recall. It's about money and not what is good for children. Why do we use so many outside agencies
for our special ed program?
Rosa Otero: Don't sign the recall. Madison and the board will restore education. Protect our OUSD kids.
Eileen McDermott: shared concerns about the recall. The top donor is a former board member. OUEA union boss is another top donor.
Julie G, OUSD parent: don't insult each other. Thanks to those members of the board that keep children safe. Not in support of the recall.
Don't sexualize young children.
Tiffany Booth, OUSD parent: posters at La Veta Elementary are indoctrination. Why are they not taken down? Should be fully
investigated.
JJ Meis, OUSD parent: Separation of church and state is in the Bill of Rights. OUSD has students from all faiths. There is not just one faith
that is dominant over all others. This is frightening.
Alex Brewsaugh, OUSD parent: comment cards were stacked in favor of those against the recall to them so they can all be heard
together. Ms. Miner bought her seat on the board. Mr. Ortega reacted aggressively to Mr. Brewsaugh on the question about why someone
was related to him. He has a conflict of interest.
Heather P.: disrespect towards the speakers is shocking. No recall. It is disrespectful to the voters and not in the best interest of the
children. Focus on hiring a new superintendent.
Lee Tousienant, OUSD parent: Wants Town Hall forums. More discussion is necessary, especially on the pool. All in other districts were
paid by bond measures. Don't dump the entire reserve in one pool. Want his kids to see that are different backgrounds. SBAC scores do
not reflect the outcome of our District.
Motion to continue the meeting until midnight by Angie Rumsey, second by Kris Erickson.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Andrea Yamasaki, Kris Erickson, Ana Page, Rick Ledesma, John Ortega, Angie Rumsey, Madison Miner
A break was held from 10:00 pm to 10:10 pm.

Soren Williams, OUSD parent: Trustees Ortega and Ledesma have been here for over 20 years and gave Dr. Hansen rave reviews. They
are the problem. Mr. Ortega has a conflict of interest in the pool. There is now chaos in the district and he's tired of the bigotry, hate, and
mismanagement.
Michelle Weisenberg: 1.2 million dollars is only if it's a standalone election. Comments are not based on reality. Schools can't even give
kids Tylenol without parental consent. The union is not behind the recall. We support our teachers and students.
Jon Sanks, OUSD parent: his daughter is learning math and reading and she's learning it well. Don't pull items until the start of the
meeting. Items don't have documentation. They need to be attached. Look at the neighbors on how they publish their agenda.
Gregory Pleasants, OUSD parent: adopt reasonable restrictions on speaking time but give people notice. Trustee Ortega should not lose
his temper. He is an involved and committed parent: Coaches a running club at Jordan, organizes parties, and attends PTA meetings.
Great parents, great students.
Jolin Lang, OUSD parent: people spoke that were not from our district. They have talking points and they go home. They just want to say
their message of hate. We care for our children.
Darshan Smalaaden, OUSD parent: OUSD is her community. We are parents. The recall will cost $313.000 when it's wrapped into an
election. The board majority is sharing information they shouldn't. You are messing with our families.

Action: B. PUBLIC HEARING - 2022-23 ESTIMATED ACTUALS AND 2023-24 PROPOSED BUDGET
Public Comment:
Kathy Moffat: Concerned about the board majority interest that expresses support of the large pool at VPHS. There is a comprehensive
facilities master plan. We need to use that plan. We can amend the plan if needed. The best way to go is to resurface the pools at Canyon
and Villa Park and one large pool at Peralta. We should finance that with a bond. Start being responsible.
Deputy Superintendent Mr. Dave Rivera and Executive Director of Business Services Ms. Bulsara presented the item. A public hearing was
held. One speaker: don't we have to adopt the budget and the LCAP at the same meeting? Some questions were answered.

8. INFORMATION / DISCUSSION ITEMS
Information: A. PROPOSED FIVE-YEAR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PLAN
Deputy Superintendent Mr. Dave Rivera presented the item. Some questions were answered.
Information: B. VILLA PARK HIGH SCHOOL POOL ESTIMATES
Public Comments:
Alex Brewsaugh, OUSD parent: Madison Miner and John Ortega used ORCA for their personal gain. He did his research. ORCA lost its
nonprofit status in 2022. They pay the hourly price as if they are a nonprofit. John Ortega has a conflict of interest.
Jon Sanks, OUSD parent: items were again not attached to the agenda. The pool needs to be repaired. We all agree. We have more pools
that need repair. Can we get a bond?
Nicol Jones, OUSD parent: Canyon High will also need a new pool. 51-meter pool for Villa Park High will give less disruption when others

are repaired as more teams can practice at the same time. An aquatics site at Peralta does not make sense. this is an extra pool that
needs care. It's a good way of attracting students to our district.
Josh Samuels: a pool is significant for the community. He swam for Team USA. Top high school programs have 50-meter pools.
Lucy Flynn, OUSD student: Villa Park High is the worst pool she has swam in since she started the swim program as a freshman. Lessons
to be learned from the El Modena High pool. With a 50-meter pool, we can have other swimmers in the pool.
Darshan Smaaladen, OUSD parent: take politics out of this discussion. John Ortega needs to recuse himself from this vote. The financial
situation is complicated. There is a lot of need.
Michael Hewitt, OUSD parent: Can we afford it? We need to be fiscally conservative.
Frank Rodriguez: we can not afford to wait. When we get a 51-meter pool, we can help other schools. The pool will break.
Senior Executive Director Administrative Services Scott Harvey presented the item. Some questions were answered. Representatives from
LPA also answered questions.
Motion to continue the meeting until 1:45 am by Madison Miner, second by Kris Erickson.

Public Comments:
Britt: $14 million is being spent in this board meeting on third-party contractors for special education. SpecEd needs to be streamlined.
Carrie Lundell, OUSD parent: why did trustee Ortega pull items for programs that are important for students at many different levels? Ask
questions before board meetings.
Scott Resnick, OUSD parent: in the last 2 meetings we are approving $750.000 for legal counsel. that's a lot of money. It cost $505.000
to fire Dr. Hansen. Voter initiatives: recall is not anti-democratic. Teachers are not enemies of the parents. Work collaboratively.
