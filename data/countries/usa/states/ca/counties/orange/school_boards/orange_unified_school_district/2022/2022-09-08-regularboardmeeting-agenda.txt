Community Schools Partnership Program Implementation

Goals :

1.1 Focus Area

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The California Community Schools Partnership Program (CCSPP) Implementation Grant will provide support to
create community schools at 11 of our Title 1 elementary sites. The CCSPP Framework leans heavily on the four established
pillars of the community schools movement. Current statute regarding the CCSPP aligns well with the research. Specifically,
community schools are defined in statute as public schools with strong and intentional community partnerships ensuring
pupil learning and whole child and family development, including the following features:

Integrated student support, which can support student success by meeting their academic, physical, social-emotional,
and mental health needs. Statute defines this as including the coordination of trauma-informed health, mental health, and
social services. Effectively supporting students also requires that students be well known so that they can be well served.
Family and community engagement, which involves actively tapping the expertise and knowledge of family and
community members to serve as true partners in supporting and educating students. Statute defines this as including
home visits, home-school collaboration, [and] culturally responsive community partnerships. Learning opportunities for
family members as well as structures and opportunities for shared leadership are other important elements of authentic
family engagement.
Collaborative leadership and practices for educators and administrators that establish a culture of professional
learning, collective trust, and shared responsibility for outcomes in a manner that includes students, families, and
community members. Statute defines this as including professional development to transform school culture and climate
that centers on pupil learning and supports mental and behavioral health, trauma-informed care, Social Emotional
Learning [and] restorative justice."
Extended learning time and opportunitiesthat include academic support, enrichment, and real-world learning
opportunities (e.g., internships, project-based learning). Statute refers to these opportunities as both extended learning
and expanded learning and defines them as including before and after school care and summer programs. Expanded
learning opportunities can also include tutoring and other learning supports during school hours.
The grant starts on June 1, 2022 and ends on June 30, 2027 and will provide eleven full-time elementary counselors (one at
each Title 1 elementary site), Sown to Grow software to help counselors identify students in need of support, eleven community
school leads to provide parent education opportunities by coordinating with local, state and community organizations, extra
earnings for child care to support parents attending trainings and funding for outside agencies to come in and provide the parent
education and student resources.

APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve

Goals :

4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The Gann Amendment provides a ceiling, or limit, on each years appropriations of tax dollars by each taxreceiving agency, including the state, cities, counties, school districts, and special districts. Proposition 4, an initiative passed in
November 1979, added controls on the growth in appropriations (Article XIII-B of the California Constitution). Using 1978-79 as a
base year, subsequent year appropriations limits have been adjusted for: (1) An inflation increase equal to the change in the
Consumer Price Index, or per capita personal income, whichever is smaller, and (2) the change in the population, which for
school agencies is the change in ADA. Proposition 111 was adopted in June 1990 and amended the Gann Limit inflation factor
to be based only on the change in per capita personal income.
The starting point for the 2022-23 Gann Limit calculation is the agency's 2021-22 Gann Limit which has increased by this year's
inflation factor and by the District's percentage increase in ADA. A second calculation is made to determine those revenues that
are subject to the limit, and ensure that a school agency is not over its limits.Not all revenue sources count against the District's
Gann Limit. Gann Limits only constrain the appropriations from state and local tax sources, and so federal aid is excluded as well
as non-tax income, such as revenues from cafeteria sales or adult education fees. It is by virtue of this calculation that almost
every school district and county office of educations expenditures are exactly at theirGann Limit. Orange Unified School District
is no exception.
In accordance with Article XIII-B of the California Constitution, a resolution must be adopted annually regarding the
appropriations limit for current and preceding fiscal years. Approval of this resolution will fulfill that requirement.
RECOMMENDATION: It is recommended that the Board of Education adopt Resolution No. 10-22-23: Gann Amendment
Appropriations Limit, for the current and preceding fiscal years in accordance with Article XIII-B of the California Constitution.
FISCAL IMPACT: The item has no fiscal impact. (Rivera/Bulsara)
