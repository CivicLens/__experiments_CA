8. ACTION ITEMS
Action: A. VILLA PARK HIGH SCHOOL AQUATIC CENTER UPDATE
Public comments:
Kristen Lambert, OUSD student: Fix pool for future generations.
Nick O'Hare, OUSD student: With a new pool all groups will be able to practice together. Events will be able to be held in our
district. This pool could be the Fred Kelly stadium for the district.
Ben, OUSD student: We don't have a large enough pool at any of the schools, so we don't have competitive clubs. We need a
new pool at Villa Park.
John Kulisich, OUSD coach: Loves the program, the coaches, and the administration. A 50-meter pool would be great. It's about
time.
Dan Rothenberg, OUSD parent: We need to move forward with a new pool, but not all questions are being addressed. What do
we do with Canyon and Orange High School?
Rosa Otero: It was said that the pool was part of Measure S. Approve the pool as promised. It's more than a sport.
Darshan Smaaladen, OUSD parent: The Villa Park pool was never part of Measure S. It was part of Measure K that did not pass.
Wants a pool for all the kids. A 50-meter pool is excessive since we have many needs in the district. It's irresponsible. Don't give
up matching funds.
Nicol Jones, OUSD parent: The plan that is presented is not accurate. There were no town hall meetings as mentioned. There are
no windows. There are no changing rooms. No team rooms. She was told that these issues are addressed, but it's not
transparent.
John Sanks, OUSD parent: Not against the pool, but needs a thoughtful discussion. Will it qualify for matching funds? The 50meter complex is a want, not a need. It needs to be a discussion.
Stephanie Lambert, OUSD parent: Always highly involved in aquatics. watched what a broken pool did to the program at Elmo.
We need to move on. We can't let this happen again. Keep talking to the stakeholders and keep students in mind.
Lorrie Kaylor: Kids at VP are getting sick from the pool. Vote yes for the sake of the kids and the community.
Deputy Superintendent Mr. Rivera, PBK Architects, and legal counsel Mr. Yeoman presented. Questions were answered.
