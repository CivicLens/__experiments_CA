  4. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
  Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Hansen stated that this has been a challenging week for many in education.  There has been a lot to deal with over the last several months, and she wants everyone to know that our hearts go out to all of our students during these challenging times, while adapting to change and then having the events going on in our nation which is weighing heavy on our hearts. It has been hard for our students not being able to be in their classroom with their teachers and their friends.  Dr. Hansen said she knows that we all look forward to welcoming our students back.  She would also like to share about the very special event that was held at the District Office.  She said as we were not able to celebrate our Employees of the Year in the usual way, the Employees of the Year were celebrated with a special drive through parade at the District offices.  They received a nice certificate and were greeted by District Staff during the drive through event. She thanked Board Members who attended this special Employee of the Year event. Thank you to Kris Erickson, Andrea Yamasaki, and Kathy Moffat who attended and stayed for the day.  There is a video of how the District honored our incredible employees in Orange Unified School District. After the video, Superintendent Hansen thanked the OUSD Communications Department for the great video; thank you to Hana Brake and Kevin Sullivan for their support in creating this video and for being present throughout the event to capture great photos.
  Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Board President John Ortega shared, as Superintendent Hansen stated there are many things occurring at this moment in time. With so many things happening at this time with COVID and the other challenges that we have.  Everyone should take this opportunity while staying home with your children to have conversations about treating others with dignity., to have respect for each other, regardless of who we are and regardless of what others look like.   As to what next year will look like, we are not yet sure.  It is still being developed as we all know. As we prepare to open in August, we will be moving forward with open dialogue, and following guidelines appropriately.   Another thing Mr. Ortega shared is a conversation with the Superintendent that perhaps it is time to start talking about having regular in person board meetings again and how that might look.  It is a possibility, but don't expect it for June 25th. He continued with thanking our all of our employees especially during this time having to be away from each other and working, we know it is hard.  We need to continue to by positive, unifying, everyone together.  We would hope we are able to congratulate our graduates in person and hold the graduation in July, where we can hold a proper graduation for our seniors.  Tonight, we have some special students that will be honored as OUSD's Highest Achievers.  These are amazing students who have done so well this year.  And that is what we are here for, to serve the students, and how we can best serve them as they move forward.  
  Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Kathy Moffat asked for the floor.  She wanted to say a big congratulations to our wonderful graduates of OUSD's class of 2020.  She said, we are so proud of you!  You have weathered not just the academic classes, but also weathered something else that none of us have ever had to do and that is weathering through the pandemic while still accomplishing going to school and other activities. You have been completing home work, and all the other things during this time with all of these health concerns.  This has been a graduation year like no other and some day you may enjoy sharing your story with your children and grandchildren. She stated, I think you are stronger for what you have gone through this year, and we all wish you the best and are very proud of you.  I would also like to recognize with gratitude and praise, Dr Hansen, at this time, for the myriad of issues, important decisions she has had to make, and all of many things she has had to handle during this time. I am so grateful that we have Dr. Hansen and all of our staff, as we are really handling and facing the challenges well.  And one case in point is her recent letter to the community regarding the issues having to do with equal treatment of every citizen, having respect and dignity for every teacher, every student, every person.   It is Important for us as a board to have an accurate view of how were are doing in this regard. This is a time not only for introspection, but also a time to look at ourselves as individuals, as a group, as a school district, as a city and as a nation to understand how we can improve to make this person, this community, this nation, more giving and loving.
  Kris Erickson said that she didn't think she could have said it any better than Ms. Moffat.  She thanked Ms. Moffat and congratulated everyone for getting through and adjusting to these hard and crazy times. Thank you to the parents for putting in the work with their students and the students for sticking with it and completing the school year.    Congratulations to everybody, we wish you all the best. There is suffering out there, people hit especially hard with COVID-19.  Communities of color and poverty are suffering especially hard, and now with the protests, we all need to be kind and understanding as people. And as a District we need to really double down on our ethics and work extra hard and make sure we are executing on that.  To the Class of 2020, these have been interesting and historic times and you are incredibly resilient.  You have gone through a lot this year and received the short end of the stick on senior year. One thing to remember, this is an experience shared with every graduate of 2020 throughout the world and something you will always have in common.  You have all been through the same experience; stay unified, love each other and good luck to all OUSD's Seniors. 
  Andrea Yamasaki said she appreciates Ms Erickson's and Ms Moffat's words and shares their same sentiments.  She said they put it into words so well that she will just leave it at that.  She is so grateful for our District, our staff and our students.  With the end of the school year and summer coming, she wanted to wish everyone the best.  In addition, she spoke about the recent OCC Council PTA meeting would like to recognize a recipient of the HSA award.  She said, our own Hana Brake was awarded the Honorary Service Award for her roll in getting out great communication to the OUSD families and the community.  She also wanted to share that another recipient of the HSA award was Orange Community Council PTA President, Sandy Davidson, who also received an award.
  Brenda Lebsack asked for the floor. Ms. Lebsack made an announcement that last evening the Orange County Board of Education announced they will hold meeting on June 24 to host a panel of experts, speaking about the reopening of schools.  She encouraged all board members to attend. She thinks the end goal will be a paper of all the ideas and solutions to be presented to school districts.  Kathy Moffat shared that there is a lot of community conversation about what will re-opening look like, and she knows that Dr. Hansen and staff have been working on the various plans and scenarios.  She suggested that because there is so much anxiety about the re-opening, the District put out as much information as possible.  It will be helpful to parents to know how many ideas and possibilities regarding the opening of schools, are being considered.

John Ortega thanked everyone and agreed that we need put out as much information as possible about reopening the schools. The method or design of how we resume, although different will always be keeping the student's health in mind.  It will be sooner rather than later as August is right around the corner.  He suggested that the Board may reconvene for a meeting just about returning to school and what that might look like. Mr. Ortega stated, It is imperative that parents have an understanding, as there are lots of questions, and we need to get the word out as to how it will look when we do re-open.

OUSD anticipates serving 350,000 over the summer at various sites across the District.  Exceptional staff packaged the meals ahead and delivered them to families, using safe PPE between staff, during transport and while serving meals.  She thanked nutritional services for how kind and serving they have been over the last few weeks.  Ms. Corella shared a short e-mail she received from a parent in the community that benefited from the meals for his family as the pandemic caused his family to struggle for necessities.

Dr. Hansen said our Nutrition Services has stepped up to work over the summer to provide these meals to our families in need.  Many of our families are really hurting right now and our schools have become an essential provider for OUSD families. She thanked Dave Rivera for his support and Patricia Reeves for doing such a great job in making our families feel welcome.

  16. PULLED ITEMS FOR ACTION/CONSIDERATION
 *Board Member Rick Ledesma requested to pull this item (prior to the consent items vote) for further discussion for better understanding for the public as well as staff and board members.
  Action (Consent): 12. B. PRECAUTIONARY BOARD RESOLUTION DECLARING INDEFINITE WORK YEAR, SALARY COMPENSATION, AND SALARY SCHEDULES DUE TO STATE BUDGET CRISIS - 32-19-20
Resolution: It is recommended that the Board of Education adopt the attached resolution prior to July 1, 2020.  It is Recommended that the Board of Education take action to pass the resolution after explanation by Asst. Supt. Human Resources.
  Action: B. Agenda Items pulled for Consideration/Action
Mr. Ortega then returned to Item 12.B and asked Mr. Ledesma to speak. Mr. Ledesma asked for a little more background wanted the meaning of this shared with public, so they would have a good understanding on what precautions are being taking for the future of the District. 
  Mr. Ernie Gonzalez, Asst. Superintendent offered to explain. He said that this item is in alignment with the previous item and conversation regarding budget.  It is a precautionary measure and does not initiate any action this evening. Approval of this resolution reserves the right of the District to take action at a later date, if it is necessary, in the current budget climate.  Because the California Ed Code states that Districts are to fix the employee salaries for the ensuing school year.  It provides for increase of salaries but it does not include language for the reduction. A failure to pass this resolution tonight would possibly preclude the district from any possibility any type of reduction or furlough days, should that become a necessary conversation to have, therefore it is advised that we pass the resolution prior to July 1st of the year so that we have that ability for the next school year.  Dr. Hansen reiterated that any action on reductions or change in the work calendar would still need to be brought back to the board. 
  Board President John Ortega asked for the motion.

  17. PUBLIC COMMENT
  18. OTHER BUSINESS
  Information: A. Board / Staff Conference and Comments
  Kathy Moffat asked for the floor and said we're proud of our District, and we know we are devoted to equity for all of our students and a welcoming safe school for all students and in this time of crisis in our country it's time for all of us to be introspective, personally and as a school district.   When we hear messages like the one that was read today by one of our speakers, about some things that have happened that were hurtful and hateful and were discriminatory and I don't know if we have a mechanism for keeping the board abreast of how often these incidents occur.  It would help us as policy-makers if we knew more, like when and how often. Ms Moffat suggested that the Superintendent perhaps design a way where the board can have an annual report of discriminatory complaints as we heard from this parent that her children had suffered painful incidents. More training, lessons in classrooms, ethnic studies, etc. to institute policies that could be helpful. We should not go forward thinking that this doesn't happen here.  Institute policies to do better, perhaps more staff trainings, ethic study for students.  Ms. Moffat said she would like the Superintendent to think on that. And she would like to ask the rest of the board members if they think it is a good idea to have an annual report to keep us abreast of these occurrences.  There was some discussion with board members.
  Andrea Yamasaki shared that this too has been heavy on her mind. She said that in light of COVID, she sees a rise in harassment and hate towards Asians, a lot of it misplaced.  Mostly just words but there have been over 1700 harassment claims filed in the United States, and she has heard of some in our district as well. If it is an issue that is pervasive then do we need a mechanism to quantify it?  How often is it happening?   Do we pass a resolution that this is something we won't tolerate? Trainings for students, parents and staff?
  Dr. Hansen said the District does have a formalized process and has board policies against discrimination, as well as anti-discrimination policies, anti bullying policies and programs.  She stated the District has done a lot of work in support of diversity and treating everyone with respect.  There are reports that we file with the office of civil rights, and we do have a system of recording the discipline regarding the discrimination.  The District also participates in a survey that is done every year.  There are ways that the District collects that data, and we can certainly provide the board with a report.  I am really proud of the work that we have done in the District regarding discrimination and there is a formal complaint process, the Uniform Complaint Process. We can provide this data to the board either with the Friday letter, board update. Dr. Hansen said, all the schools administer the Climate Survey to monitor the campuses, not only a requirement, but also something the schools want to do.  
  19. ADJOURNMENT
Board President John Ortega adjourned the meeting at 10:29 pm.
