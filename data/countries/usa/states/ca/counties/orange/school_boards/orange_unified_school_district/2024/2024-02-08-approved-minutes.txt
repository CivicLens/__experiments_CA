There was a discussion. Ms. Yamasaki formally asked Ms. Miner to recuse herself from voting because she has a conflict of
interest. Ms. Page emphasized that she wants it on the record that, in the past, she has abstained from voting if it involved
Fletcher. Ms. Page stated that she wants to ensure a moral, ethical, transparent, and legal process as it seems rushed. We need
to keep Orange Unified students in mind. Trustee Erickson stated that she agrees that OCCA students need a high school but that

this is an OCCA problem, not an OUSD problem. She claimed that the contract on this agenda is not the answer as this contract
financially hurts Orange Unified. Ms. Erickson proposed a three-year lease to get the students in the classroom. Ms. Rumsey
agreed that the process feels rushed, and is comfortable with an agreement for ten years.
Board President Ortega read the amended recommendation: It is recommended that the Board of Education take action on the

Ms. Yamasaki clarified for the record that Olive Crest rented the property, so it was not empty as stated by Mr. Ledesma.
Additionally, she noted that El Rancho and Santiago Charter are conversion charters and no one voted them down. Furthermore,
