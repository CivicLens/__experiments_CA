DESCRIPTION: January isSchool Board Recognition Month, and Orange Unified would like to take this time to recognize our
hard-working board members and educate the public about the important role that school boards play in schools and
communities. From the first public school house in an old church in San Francisco in 1850, boards of education have grown to
oversee more than 1,000 school districts and county offices of education in California. Today, California has over 5,100
California school board trustees - the largest group of elected officials in the state, who aid in supporting student success by
establishing policy priorities and benchmarks. Trustees provide a critical accountability link between the schoolsand the
community,and offer accessibility to voters that is unrivaled by other public officeholders.

This evening Orange Unified School District staff, along with OUEA and CSEA would like to honor our School Board Members
with a proclamation.

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover
assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact.
