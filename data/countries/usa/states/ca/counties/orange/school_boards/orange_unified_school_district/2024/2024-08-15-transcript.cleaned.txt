[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.000]   >> Thank you.
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:25.500]   Beginning of the new year always brings a sense of excitement and opportunity.
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:30.800]   Our theme for this year is we are OUSD, learning today, leading tomorrow.
[02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:34.800]   That embodies our commitment to providing an education that not only prepares our
[02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:39.400]   students for academic success, but also codes them with skills and
[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:42.800]   values necessary to become future leaders.
[02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:46.300]   Staff and administrators have been working throughout the summer to ensure a
[02:21:46.300 --> 02:21:52.900]   smooth start to the school year for our 25,000-plus students and 3,500 staff.
[02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:56.500]   Our transportation department is ready to make sure our students are transported
[02:21:56.500 --> 02:22:01.700]   safely to and from school, and will drive over 7,000 miles across the district on
[02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:03.100]   the first day.
[02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:08.300]   Nutrition services is ready to provide over 10,000 meals on day one, and
[02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:12.400]   maintenance and operations department has worked throughout the summer getting
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:16.800]   our sites ready and prepared for our site administrators who have been also
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:21.200]   planning and prepping to meet the needs of our students as they arrive on the
[02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:22.000]   first day of school.
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:28.700]   In particular, the administration of Villa Park High School has been working to
[02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:33.900]   continue to ensure programs and resources such as the wall space are fully
[02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:38.200]   operational despite some recent obstacles and staffing challenges that
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:41.500]   should be resolved and ready to go.
[02:22:41.500 --> 02:22:45.600]   I'm looking forward to the ed services providing a presentation through the
[02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:51.400]   board on the district's continued focus on student wellness and well spaces at
[02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:52.100]   our next meeting.
[02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:58.200]   I could go on and on and talk about the amazing things our staff and
[02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:02.700]   departments are doing to prepare for our students, but it is truly all of us who
[02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:05.600]   are working towards the common goal of preparing our students for learning
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:07.100]   today and leading tomorrow.
[02:23:07.100 --> 02:23:12.600]   At the high schools, our students and staff are returning to campus improvements
[02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:16.400]   that have been made possible due to phase two of Measure S.
[02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:19.900]   At this time, we'd like to share a video update on the projects.
[02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:34.600]   Measure S, approved by Orange Unified School District voters in 2016,
[02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:41.300]   authorized $288 million through a general obligation bond measure to modernize
[02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:45.700]   and construct facilities at our four comprehensive high schools.
[02:23:45.700 --> 02:23:53.200]   While the targeted tax rate is $29 per 100,000 of assessed valuation due to
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:57.600]   the prudent financial planning and increased overall property values
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:05.900]   residents in OUSD boundaries were taxed only $25 and 33 cents of $100,000 of
[02:24:05.900 --> 02:24:11.400]   assessed property value under 2023-2024 property taxes.
[02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:16.700]   According to district records, this equals a total tax payer savings of
[02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:23.700]   $26,799,192 since 2017.
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:29.600]   Thanks to the phase one project of Measure S, Orange Unified School District
[02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:34.700]   students and teachers now benefit from 71 state-of-the-art classrooms
[02:24:34.700 --> 02:24:40.000]   totaling over 200,000 square feet of modern teaching and learning space
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:45.800]   across cutting-edge sun centers at Canyon, Almedina, Orange, and other
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:46.800]   park high schools.
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:52.200]   We are now well into phase two of our Measure S projects, which will provide
[02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:56.300]   additional campus improvements specific to each school site's needs.
[02:24:56.300 --> 02:24:58.800]   I'd like to share our most recent updates.
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:04.600]   At Canyon High School, a 400-building project is complete with 13 classrooms
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:08.800]   and other features such as modernized student restaurants and a speech
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:09.400]   classroom.
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:14.700]   Also, as part of these upgrades, 16 portable classrooms were removed from
[02:25:14.700 --> 02:25:15.400]   the campus.
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:20.100]   We are excited to welcome Canyon High School students into the beautifully
[02:25:20.100 --> 02:25:22.700]   renovated classrooms on the first day of school.
[02:25:22.700 --> 02:25:26.300]   I think the investment on Measure S has made students so much more excited
[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:27.100]   to come to school.
[02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:33.500]   Canyon's such a great school and it's so cool to see everything being
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:35.700]   renovated and really makes me excited to come.
[02:25:35.700 --> 02:25:38.900]   I do not think it was going to look like this at all.
[02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:42.000]   I really like the color that they have and looking inside the classrooms,
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.200]   it's really big and I think it's going to be really cool.
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.700]   I think the new space is really awesome.
[02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:55.900]   It just makes our school feel more modern and new.
[02:25:55.900 --> 02:26:01.900]   At Al Medina High School, the renovation of the 800 building has been
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:06.400]   completed and the state-of-the-art facility that includes specialized
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:11.300]   spaces thoughtfully designed to inspire creativity, innovation and
[02:26:11.300 --> 02:26:15.600]   collaboration officially open for teacher and students' use last
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:16.100]   morning.
[02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:21.200]   We are also thrilled to announce that we are making great progress with
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:25.700]   the interior overhaul of the 400 and 500 classroom buildings.
[02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:31.500]   The renovation, which began during spring break 2024, is expected to
[02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:33.900]   be completed at the end of the year.
[02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:38.500]   At Orange High School, a new two-story classroom and student
[02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:43.200]   services building is receiving its final touches in preparation for its
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:45.900]   opening at the start of the upcoming school year.
[02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:51.300]   This impressive 26,000-square-foot facility features a welcoming and
[02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:56.600]   vibrant lobby of reception area, administration offices, Cal State
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:01.800]   offices, the testing room and six large new classrooms among other key
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:02.400]   spaces.
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:07.500]   Adjacent to the building is the expansive new interior courtyard.
[02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:11.900]   In addition to the new entry plaza, located at the intersection of
[02:27:11.900 --> 02:27:17.200]   Shaper and Roland Avenue, both feature natural landscaping, strategically
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:21.900]   placed trees and stylish concrete ceiling, creating campus spaces
[02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:26.300]   that inspire community interaction and provide opportunities for
[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:27.400]   student gatherings.
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:32.200]   At Villa Park High School, we are making significant progress
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:34.000]   across several key areas.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:38.600]   Earlier in the new classroom building 500, we made great strides.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:42.400]   We've connected the power to the main switch gear to energize the
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:46.000]   building and our low-voltage work is continuing smoothly.
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:50.200]   On the exterior, we've installed window glazing on all sides of
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:50.800]   the building.
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:55.200]   Inside, the restroom of grades are coming along nicely with the
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:58.800]   toxic floors, tile, and fixtures already installed.
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:02.940]   In the classrooms, focused work included the installation of
[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:06.800]   marker boards, casework, and lighting to tie everything together.
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:11.900]   As for the 100-200 building, the framing for the elevator roof and
[02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:16.200]   elevator room has been successfully completed, setting the stage for
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:19.900]   the installation of the new elevator, which is currently underway.
[02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:23.300]   The new stairs located on the south side of the building are in
[02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:24.000]   progress.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.100]   These are vital milestones as we move closer to the completion of this
[02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:31.200]   exciting modernization portion of the project.
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:36.000]   We remain on track for the anticipated opening in fall 2024, and
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.400]   we look forward to unveiling these enhanced spaces.
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:43.900]   These beautiful modern facilities coupled with our innovative
[02:28:43.900 --> 02:28:47.500]   programs and student opportunities are testament to the
[02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:50.300]   collective vision and dedication of our community.
[02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:54.900]   A special thank you to our Board of Education, the CARES Committee,
[02:28:54.900 --> 02:29:00.200]   and the entire OUSD community for your support of the measure
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:04.800]   S and the facility improvement made possible because of it.
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:12.300]   (Music)
[02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:15.600]   Well, I think as you can see our high school campuses look drastically
[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:20.100]   different after the, as we did before measure S was passed.
[02:29:20.100 --> 02:29:24.300]   Measure S really allowed us to create these modern new spaces for
[02:29:24.300 --> 02:29:27.400]   teaching and learning that reflect our shared dedication of
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:29.600]   fostering a bright future for our children.
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:33.400]   We are immensely grateful, I was stated before, to our Board of
[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:36.600]   Education, our community, and the CARES Committee for their
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:37.700]   invaluable support.
[02:29:37.700 --> 02:29:38.900]   That concludes my report.
[02:29:38.900 --> 02:29:42.700]   Thank you very much, Superintendent Gonzalez.
[02:29:42.700 --> 02:29:45.100]   Next we have the President's report.
[02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:49.900]   And as previously shared by our Superintendent, this is definitely
[02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:51.500]   an exciting time of year.
[02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:57.000]   I always thought back to school season was like, I just had more
[02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.700]   excitement compared to New Year's because it's a time of year
[02:30:00.700 --> 02:30:03.800]   where you can kind of like set new determination, set those new
[02:30:03.800 --> 02:30:09.400]   goals, and really look at your academic year ahead and really
[02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:12.200]   just envision how you want to flourish.
[02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:15.300]   And I had those wishes for all of our students.
[02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:20.000]   I've seen many pictures and posts of our teachers already starting
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.700]   to get ready and setting up their classrooms to create the best
[02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:24.300]   learning environment for our students.
[02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:28.300]   And so I know this weekend and leading up to Wednesday, a lot
[02:30:28.300 --> 02:30:31.400]   of our families are also preparing for the first day of school.
[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:38.500]   My incoming first grader is really looking forward to being able
[02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:40.900]   to play in the really big kid playground.
[02:30:40.900 --> 02:30:46.700]   And my incoming fourth grader is really nervous about the amount
[02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:50.200]   of homework that she's going to start having as one of the
[02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:53.700]   upper graders now at her elementary campus.
[02:30:53.700 --> 02:30:57.700]   But one thing that she's absolutely excited for is that
[02:30:57.700 --> 02:31:03.100]   fourth graders will now have BAPA programs, which is this year
[02:31:03.100 --> 02:31:05.600]   is expanding down to fourth grade.
[02:31:05.600 --> 02:31:07.400]   So we're really looking forward to that.
[02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:15.300]   So like I shared with a lot of our teachers and our facility staff
[02:31:15.300 --> 02:31:18.100]   and everyone is really preparing for students to come back.
[02:31:18.100 --> 02:31:23.100]   That's also a tip for our students and our families that preparation
[02:31:23.100 --> 02:31:23.600]   is key.
[02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:25.600]   Just having everything prepared the night before.
[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:29.700]   We'll really diminish the amount of stress that first morning
[02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:31.600]   as everyone goes out.
[02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:35.500]   And I know that there's parking that's going to be limited
[02:31:35.500 --> 02:31:36.800]   at a lot of our schools.
[02:31:36.800 --> 02:31:41.500]   And if you are aware, OUSD is partnering with the City of Orange
[02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:46.300]   and OPD to have trainings about school safety of like how to
[02:31:46.300 --> 02:31:49.700]   walk to school, potentially preparing volunteers to help
[02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:53.300]   as passing guards and ensuring that all of our families get
[02:31:53.300 --> 02:31:54.200]   to school safely.
[02:31:55.400 --> 02:31:58.500]   And that Mr. Gonzalez, when is the next training?
[02:31:58.500 --> 02:31:59.600]   Is it August?
[02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:04.500]   I'm going to ask Mr. Angel or his staff to clarify that because
[02:32:04.500 --> 02:32:07.700]   I think the one that we had planned, the next one that we had
[02:32:07.700 --> 02:32:10.500]   planned, it turns out that a lot of elementary schools were
[02:32:10.500 --> 02:32:12.700]   planning their back to school on the same night.
[02:32:12.700 --> 02:32:16.700]   So I think they're working with the police department to reschedule
[02:32:16.700 --> 02:32:19.300]   that one so that way people don't have to choose between the two.
[02:32:19.300 --> 02:32:21.100]   So more information to come on.
[02:32:21.100 --> 02:32:24.600]   Okay, so definitely check our social media and websites.
[02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:27.800]   And I'm sure the principals will send out a message once that
[02:32:27.800 --> 02:32:28.900]   date is finalized.
[02:32:28.900 --> 02:32:34.200]   But those are my new years wishes for all of our students and
[02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:34.800]   teachers.
[02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:36.000]   Thank you.
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:40.000]   Next we have board recognition of students, staff and community
[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.800]   and I would like to start with Trustee Erickson and kind of
[02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:45.700]   just go down and conclude with Mr. Trannick.
[02:32:45.700 --> 02:32:46.200]   That's okay.
[02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:49.000]   Thank you.
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:53.400]   I'm excited to hear about all of the everything going on at
[02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:56.500]   the schools and I really want to thank my teachers and our
[02:32:56.500 --> 02:32:59.800]   staff who I know have been really hard at work to welcome our
[02:32:59.800 --> 02:33:00.700]   students back.
[02:33:00.700 --> 02:33:03.800]   I hope everybody had some rest the summer and enjoyed themselves
[02:33:03.800 --> 02:33:04.800]   a little bit as well.
[02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:08.900]   I wanted to just give a shout out to a community member.
[02:33:08.900 --> 02:33:13.800]   Her name is Tonda Fields and seven years ago she started a
[02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:17.300]   backpack and school supply collection for students in need.
[02:33:17.300 --> 02:33:22.200]   And I think seven years ago she raised about $500 around there.
[02:33:23.100 --> 02:33:29.200]   But each year it's grown and this year in just 13 days she
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:34.000]   collected and donated 320 backpacks full of school supplies
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.400]   96 of those went to the Friendly Center.
[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:42.200]   224 of those went to Orange Unified for our students and
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:45.300]   some of our Friendly Center backpacks will also go to
[02:33:45.300 --> 02:33:47.700]   Orange Unified students as well because they're a community
[02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:51.600]   partner that we have and it included all sorts of things
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:57.300]   like three-ring binders, 1,152 number two pencils, 385 pairs
[02:33:57.300 --> 02:34:01.700]   of scissors, index cards, highlighters and everything,
[02:34:01.700 --> 02:34:05.700]   302 reusable water bottles which goes really nicely with our
[02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:10.600]   new bottle filling stations and it's environmentally sound.
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:11.400]   So that was good.
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:15.500]   But her total value of donations and that includes people who
[02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:21.500]   donated people but just monetary value was $8,778
[02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:25.900]   and $0.07 in school supplies for our students in need.
[02:34:25.900 --> 02:34:28.400]   And I just wanted to give that community member a shout out
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:33.800]   because that's a huge thing for our students and that's a labor
[02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:36.400]   of love for her and so we really appreciate it.
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:48.100]   Well, good evening.
[02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:51.000]   Well, I'm not going to say anything too different from what
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.400]   Superintendent Gonzalez and President Page said.
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:57.100]   Just welcoming everybody back.
[02:34:57.100 --> 02:35:00.600]   It's been exciting as I've been out and about to see everything
[02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:02.000]   going on at the school sites.
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.400]   I have not passed by a single school site and not seen cars
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:10.500]   in the parking lot, maintenance crews on the grounds.
[02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:15.500]   It really, it goes on all summer but it really starts long
[02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:16.400]   before school starts.
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:18.100]   The principals have already been back.
[02:35:18.100 --> 02:35:20.000]   Lots of things are happening.
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:23.000]   I've run into some district staff and they're frazzled
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.900]   because that's their busiest time of the year probably getting
[02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:27.100]   ready for everybody to come back.
[02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:29.300]   So there's so much preparation that goes into it but I want
[02:35:29.300 --> 02:35:33.000]   to thank all of our maintenance crews, our classified staff,
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:37.700]   the bus drivers have already gone out, doing their practice runs.
[02:35:37.700 --> 02:35:39.600]   There's just so much involved.
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:42.000]   Teachers are already in their classrooms because you can never
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:43.500]   prepare enough when you do.
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:49.300]   And I've also, I wanted to just mention with the measure S update.
[02:35:49.300 --> 02:35:50.400]   It was so good to see that.
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:55.600]   I've seen a lot of people just recently who have come up to me
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:35:59.900]   and said, wow, I just went by Panhand or Orange High School
[02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:02.100]   or Villa Park and the schools are looking great.
[02:36:02.100 --> 02:36:08.100]   I talked to a gentleman this morning who was one of the graduates
[02:36:08.100 --> 02:36:12.700]   of Orange High when they walked over from the Chapman campus
[02:36:12.900 --> 02:36:15.800]   to Orange High in 1952.
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:16.300]   Okay.
[02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:16.800]   Yeah.
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:22.200]   And he was wearing an orange Panther shirt, which I thought
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:23.000]   was pretty cool.
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:26.500]   And so I started a conversation with him, but he said he's not
[02:36:26.500 --> 02:36:30.300]   been by to see this latest building, but I urged him
[02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:33.200]   to please go by and a lot of a lot of the people with him
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:35.300]   were saying, oh my gosh, it's just amazing.
[02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:38.200]   And I know I was at a meeting earlier this week and I think
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:42.000]   it was Dr. Glass was mentioning pride in our district
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.200]   and we want our students to have that pride as a principal
[02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:47.200]   fletcher.
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:50.300]   My kind of tagline was don't forget to show your felt pride
[02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:53.800]   and now I really want to extend that to don't forget to show
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:56.700]   your OUSD pride and I don't think we're going to have trouble
[02:36:56.700 --> 02:36:59.900]   with that this year because we have you saw those students in
[02:36:59.900 --> 02:37:03.000]   the video are really excited and really proud and I think
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.900]   all of us are really excited and proud about what's happened.
[02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:09.400]   So again, thank you to the to the everyone who helped with
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:11.900]   measure S because that's really been very successful.
[02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:14.200]   So here's to a great school year.
[02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:15.500]   Thank you.
[02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:19.500]   Thank you.
[02:37:19.500 --> 02:37:22.700]   I'm going to just reiterate what everyone else said.
[02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:25.100]   I hope everyone had a really nice summer.
[02:37:25.100 --> 02:37:26.500]   It went by really quickly.
[02:37:26.500 --> 02:37:31.100]   I think I think everyone agrees with me on that and it was
[02:37:31.100 --> 02:37:34.800]   really wonderful to see all the updates on the facilities
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:39.000]   measurements facilities at each of the campuses and can't
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.300]   wait to see the faces of my kids when they work in.
[02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:45.300]   As we start another exciting school year, I want to extend
[02:37:45.300 --> 02:37:48.900]   the warm welcome to all of our students, teachers, staff
[02:37:48.900 --> 02:37:50.100]   and administration.
[02:37:50.100 --> 02:37:53.100]   Of course, I'd like to welcome our newest employees.
[02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:57.500]   The beginning of a new the new school year is always filled
[02:37:57.500 --> 02:38:01.400]   with anticipation new opportunities and hopefully
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:02.000]   some fun.
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:06.700]   Our teachers have been diligently preparing and engaging
[02:38:06.700 --> 02:38:09.800]   and providing a supportive environment for our students
[02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:11.100]   and I want to thank them too.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:15.600]   I wish everyone the best as we start the new school year.
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:20.700]   I would also like to thank the new principal over at Medina
[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:25.700]   Block King for meeting with Trustee Erickson and myself to
[02:38:25.700 --> 02:38:29.000]   share his background and vision and we wish them all the best.
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:32.800]   And I also want to acknowledge Tauna Fields and I think
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:33.600]   Chris said it all.
[02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:38.500]   And the last thing I want to say is I'm really sad to report
[02:38:38.500 --> 02:38:41.600]   that one of our students, our former students are Mando
[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:46.900]   Madrano who graduated in 2023 passed away earlier this
[02:38:46.900 --> 02:38:49.200]   whole year due to fentanyl poisoning.
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:55.600]   And I want to take a moment to thank the staff, the district
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:59.000]   principal Mikea over at Canyon High School and the football
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:02.300]   family because they're organizing a moment of silence at
[02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:06.900]   the football game this next Friday at August on August
[02:39:06.900 --> 02:39:08.500]   23rd at 6.45.
[02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:12.000]   So if you want to attend we'll be doing that.
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:16.300]   Anaheim City and another organization will be there.
[02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:19.200]   They're going to be distributing information to bring
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:20.700]   awareness on fentanyl.
[02:39:20.700 --> 02:39:28.500]   And I just want to say how sad my respect to the Madrano
[02:39:28.500 --> 02:39:30.900]   family because I know this is a huge house for them.
[02:39:30.900 --> 02:39:34.800]   She's like 19 so it's really heartbreaking.
[02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:36.700]   Thank you.
[02:39:36.700 --> 02:39:42.900]   So good evening everyone.
[02:39:42.900 --> 02:39:45.800]   Thank you for being in attendance and thank you for this
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:49.400]   opportunity to address you again as everyone else I already
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:53.000]   mentioned we want to welcome everyone back to the new academic
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:56.100]   year thanking all of the administrators for all their
[02:39:56.100 --> 02:39:59.000]   hard work, the faculty, the staff and of course the district
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.600]   administration for everything that they've done under the
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:03.800]   direction and leadership of our superintendent.
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:08.000]   And so as we close the summer semester I would like to stress
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.000]   a couple of things.
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.600]   I want to talk about briefly a couple of different programs
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:14.000]   that were in existence this summer.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:18.100]   One is the Yorba Summers team program under the direction
[02:40:18.100 --> 02:40:21.800]   leadership of Dr. Michael Luther, an excellent program.
[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:24.800]   One of my nephews attended that program and brought home
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:28.100]   something delicious to eat every day.
[02:40:28.100 --> 02:40:32.900]   And Spam Missouvi, if you don't know what it is, learn about
[02:40:32.900 --> 02:40:34.000]   it, it's very good.
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:37.300]   So it's excellent and I'm very thankful for that program.
[02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:40.000]   My second program I wanted to talk about is something that
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:43.000]   maybe many of you are aware of which is the CARES program
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:46.800]   Center for After School Recreation Enrichment and Safety.
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:50.200]   The program is a district-wide program but of course in the
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:55.400]   summer trunkings and so two of my kids went to the MacPherson
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:59.300]   satellite and we couldn't have done everything we do in the
[02:40:59.300 --> 02:41:01.600]   summer my wife and I without CARES.
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:04.400]   So very appreciative of them and I'm going to take a moment
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:06.900]   of personal privilege and name many of them.
[02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:11.500]   Ms. Violet, Ms. Josie, Ms. Erica, Mr. Josh, Ms. Alyssa,
[02:41:11.500 --> 02:41:15.800]   Ms. Brianna, Coach Cameron, and Ms. Novia who also works
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:18.700]   at Palmyra but she was over at MacPherson.
[02:41:18.700 --> 02:41:21.800]   And listen, what they do is amazing.
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:23.800]   They're unsung heroes.
[02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:27.200]   They're here for obviously for the adults, we have to do
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:29.400]   burn the day, but the kids have a great time now.
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:32.400]   So it's very wonderful to have them there and they're very
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:35.100]   safe, they're engaged and they have a lot of fun.
[02:41:35.100 --> 02:41:38.000]   And then finally I want to mention and celebrate all those
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:41.700]   who participated in the CSTEM professional development that
[02:41:41.700 --> 02:41:43.300]   was held at Portola Middle School.
[02:41:43.300 --> 02:41:47.400]   And so I want to really shout out Greg Miller who invited
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:52.200]   me to see my personal doctoral student from Long Beach State
[02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:55.300]   Jeff Hascott who was one of the co-pacilitators.
[02:41:55.300 --> 02:41:58.700]   I wasn't able to go because my nephews like COVID.
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:01.200]   So they started to go back and forth with who had COVID
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:01.800]   last week.
[02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:02.400]   It was great.
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:04.100]   They enjoy it.
[02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:06.800]   I want to make sure everyone knows that.
[02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:08.800]   Stay healthy, stay healthy.
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:11.800]   So just as we begin the academic year, I want to wish all
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:14.400]   the students, the teachers, the families a wonderful start.
[02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:17.800]   And in the words of the great Mary McLeod, the whole world
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:21.400]   opened to me when I learned to read and education.
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:24.500]   As we know is the key to unlocking so many doors that
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:25.700]   are endless possibilities.
[02:42:25.700 --> 02:42:28.200]   We want to make sure that you embark on an incredible
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:30.800]   journey and embark on this together.
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:33.600]   So thank you all very much and have a wonderful academic
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:33.800]   year.
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:40.500]   I just want to briefly wish the students a wonderful and
[02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:43.900]   successful year both academically and socially.
[02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:48.000]   I want to wish the teachers a successful year that their
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:52.300]   passion for teaching would grow and they would have clarity
[02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:54.400]   with both their students and with parents.
[02:42:54.400 --> 02:42:57.700]   And I don't want to forget the administrators as well that
[02:42:57.700 --> 02:43:04.300]   they have a wonderful successful year and that they that their
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:07.900]   schools are organized and that they would also have clarity.
[02:43:07.900 --> 02:43:11.500]   And I want to thank you all for everything that you do.
[02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:16.000]   Thank you.
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:16.400]   Thank you.
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:21.000]   I was I would be remiss if I didn't think that orange
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.100]   and apply public schools foundation and all their
[02:43:23.100 --> 02:43:26.700]   volunteers for organizing the street there that's coming
[02:43:26.700 --> 02:43:28.300]   up every day a weekend.
[02:43:28.300 --> 02:43:34.200]   They are having a bounce house and they're looking
[02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:35.000]   for volunteers.
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.800]   So if you need if you want to volunteer I know some of us
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:39.400]   will be there.
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:42.700]   So I hope to see you there and I think all our volunteers
[02:43:42.700 --> 02:43:43.400]   for doing that.
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:48.700]   Of course while happening over at Boulevard High School our
[02:43:48.700 --> 02:43:52.800]   associated student body went on this Orange County leadership
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:55.900]   expedition to University of California Santa Barbara.
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:57.000]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:00.100]   I've been a part of this in my four years and I never once
[02:44:00.100 --> 02:44:02.500]   but I've seen plenty of videos and my friends have sent me
[02:44:02.500 --> 02:44:05.200]   and I know for a fact that I'm definitely missing out.
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:08.500]   So I wanted to do that in this past week and also next Monday
[02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:10.200]   we have registration.
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:13.700]   This is an opportunity for students to really familiarize
[02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:18.200]   themselves with the campus which unfortunately is due to close
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:21.500]   out to a lot of construction right and you can pass by
[02:44:21.500 --> 02:44:24.700]   and the sound of the campus is not totally wide and kind of
[02:44:24.700 --> 02:44:28.100]   resembles a lot of the science building and also the measure
[02:44:28.100 --> 02:44:31.400]   space to building as well but also in Registration Week
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:34.100]   there's an opportunity for sports and also student
[02:44:34.100 --> 02:44:37.500]   organizations to present themselves and gather new members
[02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:40.500]   my club and our club with that as well.
[02:44:40.500 --> 02:44:41.600]   We've got a bunch of candies.
[02:44:41.600 --> 02:44:44.000]   Hey come join our club and the quid pro quo.
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.200]   I guess gets to add on to that.
[02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:49.800]   We also have a new assistant principal and special education.
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:53.600]   Mr. Scott Suka who's been with the district for 10 almost
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:55.100]   two to three decades.
[02:44:55.100 --> 02:44:59.200]   And it was also the CTE coordinator at Willow Park High
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:03.200]   School and also as a part-time government economics teacher
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:03.800]   as well.
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:06.400]   So that's all Billow Park High School and looking forward
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:09.000]   to report for the next right now the following school year.
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:09.500]   Thank you.
[02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:10.900]   Thank you Mr. Chair.
[02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:15.300]   Item five approval of the minutes.
[02:45:15.300 --> 02:45:18.700]   We have two different board meetings.
[02:45:18.700 --> 02:45:21.200]   Would you like to take them both together or separately.
[02:45:22.100 --> 02:45:24.700]   I've got a correction on June 26.
[02:45:24.700 --> 02:45:25.200]   Okay.
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:31.100]   But it says we appointed Bob Kim it should say Bob King.
[02:45:31.100 --> 02:45:32.200]   Oh you already did that.
[02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:32.600]   Okay.
[02:45:32.600 --> 02:45:34.400]   I missed the vote on that.
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:34.800]   Sorry.
[02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:38.800]   Should you take them separately since we were not at the time.
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:45.800]   So the first one that correction was already made.
[02:45:45.900 --> 02:45:46.300]   Okay.
[02:45:46.300 --> 02:45:58.900]   I think we should approve it with the correction.
[02:45:58.900 --> 02:46:02.600]   Okay Trustee Erickson would you like to make the motion.
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:06.100]   Yes I will move it with the correction to change the name
[02:46:06.100 --> 02:46:11.500]   to Kim from Kim to King on item C. Okay.
[02:46:11.500 --> 02:46:12.300]   Is there a second?
[02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:15.800]   Thank you I need additional discussion.
[02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:18.100]   All in favor.
[02:46:18.100 --> 02:46:22.000]   All right motion passes seven zero.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:27.700]   Five B approval of the minutes July 18th 2024 is our motion
[02:46:27.700 --> 02:46:30.700]   or you had additional comments or questions.
[02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:39.000]   Thank you I was looking at item 8A and I know we don't go into
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.800]   great detail with minutes but I was wondering if board would
[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:45.000]   be willing to add a sentence.
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:54.700]   Where it says Miss Moscarinas from PBK presented the item
[02:46:54.700 --> 02:46:59.700]   and I wanted to add centered on the escalation of project cost
[02:46:59.700 --> 02:47:10.100]   estimate to $19,829,185 from $15,891,204.
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:20.600]   I just wanted to include what the discussion was and those
[02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:23.900]   amounts in case anybody wants to review those minutes.
[02:47:23.900 --> 02:47:28.300]   I think that would be relevant and we did talk about it.
[02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:37.100]   This was what was on our agenda item cost estimate on our
[02:47:37.100 --> 02:47:45.300]   agenda item was $19,829,185 and the original estimation was
[02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:50.000]   $15,891,204.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:55.700]   Okay, so would you like to make a motion with that addition?
[02:47:55.700 --> 02:47:56.700]   I would.
[02:47:56.700 --> 02:48:01.500]   I would like to make a motion to amend the minutes so that
[02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:10.200]   after Ms. Moscarinas from PBK presented the item, centered on
[02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:19.700]   the escalation of project cost estimate to $19,829,185 from
[02:48:19.700 --> 02:48:24.700]   $15,891,204 period.
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.600]   Second, Trustee probably seconds.
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:32.300]   Any additional discussion?
[02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:36.000]   Yeah, I do have just a question with that.
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:40.000]   Is there precedent to refer back to the notes and update
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.700]   the original cost and the new cost with escalation?
[02:48:43.700 --> 02:48:46.300]   Because it just, it seems interesting to me that we're
[02:48:46.300 --> 02:48:48.800]   making that move when there is, I'm just asking,
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:51.700]   was precedent to let that occur?
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:57.800]   I believe she's adding documentation to what was
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:48:59.000]   discussed at that meeting.
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.800]   So it's just adding clarification and details.
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:06.800]   Yeah, and I was probably saying, you know, yes and no.
[02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:11.100]   I think when we look at minutes, you know, from our meetings
[02:49:11.100 --> 02:49:17.300]   that we tend to summarize, you know, what it's about.
[02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:20.100]   So there are times in which it doesn't say exactly word for
[02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:21.100]   word what's there.
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:25.500]   So I think if there's interest by the board to change something,
[02:49:25.500 --> 02:49:28.000]   the numbers we can check.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:36.100]   So, you know, but in terms of making a better summary of what
[02:49:36.100 --> 02:49:39.400]   occurred, I think that there's no issue there in terms of
[02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:42.100]   if the board wanted to do that because we don't, you know,
[02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:45.200]   go through and kind of say what every single person said along
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:47.200]   the way, we just kind of make that general summary.
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:50.700]   If the board feels like they want to make that better or
[02:49:50.700 --> 02:49:52.400]   change that, then it's still a summary.
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:55.200]   Within their overview.
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:57.500]   Absolutely.
[02:49:57.500 --> 02:50:01.200]   It's just, it seems to me that from the last presentation,
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:04.200]   what's pertinent or germane to that presentation wasn't exactly
[02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:07.000]   the original cost, but was the uptickets right?
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:10.100]   If anybody or the board wants to revert back to the original
[02:50:10.100 --> 02:50:12.200]   cost of the pool, they could easily look back.
[02:50:12.200 --> 02:50:15.300]   I believe it was, you know, the reverend meeting that gave
[02:50:15.300 --> 02:50:17.300]   that $15 million dollar estimation.
[02:50:17.300 --> 02:50:20.000]   So it just seems kind of off to me that we're adding that
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:23.300]   when there's public record to that $15 million project,
[02:50:23.300 --> 02:50:26.300]   the intent of the presentation last meeting was to update
[02:50:26.300 --> 02:50:29.000]   the $4 million cost that suddenly arisen, right?
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:33.400]   So just that was intent and I would assume that was intent
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:35.700]   of the presentation, not the original cost.
[02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:39.000]   So it just seems to me that that move here is a little bit
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:42.200]   of a political play and intention to, you know,
[02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:44.500]   present to the public that, hey, this is a, you know,
[02:50:44.500 --> 02:50:47.900]   originally $15 million pool, now it's $19 million pool.
[02:50:48.300 --> 02:50:53.000]   And because of that, I guess, you know, that's all I have to
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:53.600]   say, thank you.
[02:50:53.600 --> 02:50:57.200]   Well, I think just to be clear, I did say the cost estimate,
[02:50:57.200 --> 02:51:00.800]   the escalation of project cost estimate and then I'm just
[02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:02.500]   including the actual numbers.
[02:51:02.500 --> 02:51:05.400]   If we wanted to include the original cost estimate of $25
[02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:07.500]   million dollars, we could probably do that too.
[02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:11.300]   But I think this would probably be sufficient to give the
[02:51:11.300 --> 02:51:14.700]   reader a better idea of what it was that we were discussing.
[02:51:14.700 --> 02:51:17.800]   I believe the $25 million dollar estimation was with
[02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:20.600]   another, the architect or another contractor, I believe.
[02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:24.000]   I believe that you wise stick with the current contractor,
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:24.200]   right?
[02:51:24.200 --> 02:51:27.200]   But again, there's just public records state that there's
[02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:31.000]   a $15 million original estimation of this.
[02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:35.000]   And if they're interested in revisiting that number, you
[02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.800]   can easily look back at the documentation that we previously
[02:51:37.800 --> 02:51:38.700]   can currently have.
[02:51:38.700 --> 02:51:41.600]   So, board president, we were able to check the board
[02:51:41.600 --> 02:51:42.300]   presentation.
[02:51:42.300 --> 02:51:44.400]   It looks like that those numbers are correct.
[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:46.600]   So, I believe you have a motion.
[02:51:46.600 --> 02:51:49.000]   You have a motion and you have a second.
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:52.500]   And I think the board has had an opportunity to discuss.
[02:51:52.500 --> 02:51:55.100]   I would just like to add that.
[02:51:55.100 --> 02:51:59.000]   I think it was done in transparency purposes.
[02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:00.800]   There's nothing that we're trying to hide.
[02:52:00.800 --> 02:52:03.500]   Yes, certainly someone can go look up this information,
[02:52:03.500 --> 02:52:06.300]   but why not put it out there because it's transparent.
[02:52:06.300 --> 02:52:06.800]   That's it.
[02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:16.100]   And to address your question squarely, is there a precedent
[02:52:16.100 --> 02:52:16.600]   for it?
[02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:19.000]   No, there's not a precedent for it.
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:23.800]   And in the interest of being transparent, it's probably wise
[02:52:23.800 --> 02:52:28.300]   to do it because the idea of an update is to also add the amount.
[02:52:28.300 --> 02:52:31.700]   I think that you, I can't have one without the other in my opinion.
[02:52:31.700 --> 02:52:35.000]   So, I think that reasonably speaking, you got to get a question.
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:38.700]   And at the same time, I think it's important to note for the
[02:52:38.700 --> 02:52:41.000]   public that this was the update.
[02:52:41.500 --> 02:52:46.100]   Without the actual amount that was escalated, then there's no
[02:52:46.100 --> 02:52:47.000]   purpose for the update.
[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.900]   You know what I'm saying?
[02:52:49.900 --> 02:52:51.400]   But why would we even talk about it?
[02:52:51.400 --> 02:52:52.200]   Absolutely.
[02:52:52.200 --> 02:52:55.400]   But I mean, I, again, you make great point about transparency,
[02:52:55.400 --> 02:52:58.400]   but it seemed like we're, you know, hiding the original numbers,
[02:52:58.400 --> 02:52:58.600]   right?
[02:52:58.600 --> 02:53:00.500]   The numbers were already there.
[02:53:00.500 --> 02:53:03.600]   The public could easily revisit the documentations and find
[02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:06.500]   that the original cost was $15 billion.
[02:53:06.500 --> 02:53:10.500]   What seems to be here that to add that on the meeting notes is
[02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:12.900]   a little bit of political play about to play with us because
[02:53:12.900 --> 02:53:15.600]   again, transparency, the transparency is there.
[02:53:15.600 --> 02:53:24.800]   All in favor.
[02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:32.700]   We have five ayes, which means two abstentions or absence.
[02:53:34.700 --> 02:53:42.800]   Question carries. Thank you. Six eight public comment.
[02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:44.000]   Trustee Erickson.
[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:52.800]   Yes, we have one public comment on an agenda item and then
[02:53:52.800 --> 02:53:58.000]   we have six public comments on non-agenda.
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:04.000]   So persons wishing to speak should submit a public comment
[02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:05.100]   as part of the meeting.
[02:54:05.100 --> 02:54:07.800]   In general, individual speakers will be allowed three minutes
[02:54:07.800 --> 02:54:10.200]   to address the board on each agenda or non-agenda item.
[02:54:10.200 --> 02:54:12.800]   The board shall limit the total time for public input on each
[02:54:12.800 --> 02:54:13.900]   item to 30 minutes.
[02:54:13.900 --> 02:54:16.700]   The speaker shall not yield to another person in any portion
[02:54:16.700 --> 02:54:18.700]   of the time allotted to the murder to speak.
[02:54:18.700 --> 02:54:23.000]   The total amount for agenda items and non-agenda items at regular
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:24.300]   meetings shall be 30 minutes.
[02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:27.700]   The time allowed for those who may request to speak shall be
[02:54:27.700 --> 02:54:28.400]   as followed.
[02:54:28.400 --> 02:54:30.900]   And I'm just going to read in this case one to 10 speakers
[02:54:30.900 --> 02:54:32.700]   will each be allowed three minutes.
[02:54:32.700 --> 02:54:35.700]   So since we only have one speaker, it will be a lot of three
[02:54:35.700 --> 02:54:36.300]   minutes.
[02:54:36.300 --> 02:54:41.100]   The number of speakers to any agenda or non-agenda item will
[02:54:41.100 --> 02:54:44.300]   be determined just prior to the time that item is considered
[02:54:44.300 --> 02:54:47.100]   and speakers must be present to be counted in the total district
[02:54:47.100 --> 02:54:49.400]   students who have presented a request to speak will be allowed
[02:54:49.400 --> 02:54:53.100]   to speak before other individuals who have also requested to
[02:54:53.100 --> 02:54:56.200]   speak individual speaking time may not be reduced to less than
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:54:56.800]   one minute.
[02:54:56.800 --> 02:55:00.600]   Those presented with us to speak but could not be accommodated
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:04.700]   within the allotted time will be allowed one minute each.
[02:55:04.700 --> 02:55:08.500]   So the only thing is we do have some students on non-agenda
[02:55:08.500 --> 02:55:08.800]   items.
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:11.200]   So I don't know if the board would like to take the three
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:14.400]   students now or if we just want to wait to item 17.
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:18.800]   So the way our bylaw reads is that they would go first when
[02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:19.900]   you take up the item.
[02:55:19.900 --> 02:55:22.600]   So really that would be at 17.
[02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:25.900]   However, at the board's discretion, they can choose to
[02:55:25.900 --> 02:55:30.000]   hear in a public comment at a different time.
[02:55:30.300 --> 02:55:31.400]   So we have a short meeting.
[02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:34.000]   We can just continue on with our agenda.
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000]   Okay.
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.500]   And then our speakers ask to item 8c.
[02:55:38.500 --> 02:55:39.700]   So it's not quite yet.
[02:55:39.700 --> 02:55:40.600]   7c.
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:41.300]   8c.
[02:55:41.300 --> 02:55:42.100]   Okay.
[02:55:42.100 --> 02:55:42.400]   Yeah.
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:43.000]   Thank you.
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:43.600]   All right.
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:47.300]   7a employment agreement for interim assistant superintendent
[02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:48.500]   educational services.
[02:55:48.500 --> 02:55:49.700]   Mr. Gonzalez.
[02:55:49.700 --> 02:55:50.400]   Thank you.
[02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:54.800]   At our last meeting, the board appointed and Truick's to interim
[02:55:54.800 --> 02:55:57.400]   assistant superintendent of educational services.
[02:55:57.400 --> 02:55:58.300]   She's right over here.
[02:55:59.100 --> 02:56:07.000]   This item is this item is to approve the employment agreement.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:10.000]   So it is recommended that the board of education approve the
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.900]   employment agreement for the interim assistant superintendent
[02:56:12.900 --> 02:56:18.700]   of educational services effective July 22nd 2024 and continuing
[02:56:18.700 --> 02:56:22.300]   until the new assistant superintendent educational
[02:56:22.300 --> 02:56:27.500]   services is appointed and reports to duty and disappointment
[02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:33.300]   is at a range of 170 of the option C leadership based salary
[02:56:33.300 --> 02:56:37.900]   schedule and authorized and we would like to authorize the
[02:56:37.900 --> 02:56:41.400]   president and clerk of the board of education to sign the
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:43.600]   agreement of employment on behalf of the board.
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:45.900]   Thank you.
[02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:48.800]   Is there a motion on the recommended recommendations?
[02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:50.900]   Thank you.
[02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:55.500]   Trustee Erickson, any discussion or comments?
[02:56:56.900 --> 02:56:57.800]   All in favor?
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:00.100]   Okay.
[02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:01.500]   Motion passes 7-0.
[02:57:01.500 --> 02:57:02.500]   Congratulations.
[02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:10.400]   That is the declaration of possible need for fully qualified
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:13.400]   educators required annual report.
[02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:19.800]   All right.
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:22.200]   Good evening, President Page, members of the board,
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:24.600]   Superintendent Gonzalez, Cabinet and community.
[02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:28.500]   This evening we have a revised declaration of possible need
[02:57:28.500 --> 02:57:31.900]   for fully qualified educators required annual report on the
[02:57:31.900 --> 02:57:33.000]   agenda for approval.
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:36.200]   The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing pursuant
[02:57:36.200 --> 02:57:40.600]   to Title V Section 80026 of the California Code of Regulations
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:43.700]   requires school districts to file with the commission an
[02:57:43.700 --> 02:57:47.000]   annual declaration of need for fully qualified educators as
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:50.600]   a prerequisite to the commission's issuance of an emergency
[02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:53.000]   or limited assignment permits for employees.
[02:57:53.700 --> 02:57:56.100]   In response to this requirement, a declaration of need for
[02:57:56.100 --> 02:57:59.800]   2024-2025 school year was approved by the board at the
[02:57:59.800 --> 02:58:00.800]   March 4 meeting.
[02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:04.600]   The revised declaration of need is required to account for
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:08.200]   the increased hiring of visual and performing arts and dual
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:12.500]   language immersion educators expected for the 2024-2025
[02:58:12.500 --> 02:58:13.000]   school year.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:16.100]   The declaration of need may be further revised at a later
[02:58:16.100 --> 02:58:18.700]   date based upon actual usage or need.
[02:58:18.700 --> 02:58:22.000]   So tonight I recommended that the Board of Education approve
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:25.500]   the declaration of need for 2024-2025 school year.
[02:58:25.500 --> 02:58:28.500]   In simple terms, it helps provide flexibility when it comes
[02:58:28.500 --> 02:58:30.100]   to hiring employees first year.
[02:58:30.100 --> 02:58:33.800]   Thank you, Ms. Nid.
[02:58:33.800 --> 02:58:35.700]   Is there a motion?
[02:58:35.700 --> 02:58:39.300]   Thank you, Trustee Renzi.
[02:58:39.300 --> 02:58:43.000]   Trustee Pele will second.
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:46.600]   Any discussion or comments?
[02:58:46.600 --> 02:58:49.900]   All in favor?
[02:58:50.400 --> 02:58:50.900]   Aye.
[02:58:50.900 --> 02:58:53.300]   Any opposed?
[02:58:53.300 --> 02:58:57.700]   So, motion passes 601.
[02:58:57.700 --> 02:58:59.500]   Thank you.
[02:58:59.500 --> 02:59:00.700]   Thank you.
[02:59:00.700 --> 02:59:06.900]   Okay, item A45, day budget revised report.
[02:59:06.900 --> 02:59:18.200]   Ms. Holgen will present on this item with Ms. Balsara.
[02:59:18.200 --> 02:59:19.200]   Thank you.
[02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:19.700]   Thank you.
[02:59:19.700 --> 02:59:28.600]   Thank you, Superintendent Gonzalez.
[02:59:28.600 --> 02:59:31.100]   Good evening, Madam President, distinguished board members,
[02:59:31.100 --> 02:59:33.800]   Superintendent Gonzalez, cabinet members, and community
[02:59:33.800 --> 02:59:37.100]   partners with us here tonight and those joining us virtually.
[02:59:37.100 --> 02:59:41.900]   Tonight in collaboration with our Executive Director of
[02:59:41.900 --> 02:59:45.300]   Business Services, Meg Nabil-Sara, we are here to provide
[02:59:45.300 --> 02:59:49.000]   the Board with a presentation regarding the 45-day revised
[02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:53.200]   report requirements, updates for the 24-25 enacted budget,
[02:59:53.200 --> 02:59:54.500]   and next steps.
[02:59:54.500 --> 02:59:56.200]   I will now hand it over to Meg.
[02:59:56.200 --> 03:00:01.400]   Thank you, Ms. Holgen.
[03:00:01.400 --> 03:00:05.900]   So, good evening, everyone.
[03:00:05.900 --> 03:00:10.000]   Now, good evening, board members, Superintendent Gonzalez,
[03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:13.300]   cabinet members, and community members and colleagues present
[03:00:13.300 --> 03:00:15.000]   here and watching online.
[03:00:16.300 --> 03:00:22.800]   So, per code section 42127, when Governor adopts the budget
[03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:27.500]   in July, then, sorry, when Governor adopts the budget
[03:00:27.500 --> 03:00:32.300]   in July, then school districts are required to present those
[03:00:32.300 --> 03:00:36.800]   budget changes to public and board review within 45 days,
[03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:39.500]   and that was on August 12th.
[03:00:39.500 --> 03:00:45.000]   So, we presented, we actually provided those information
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:48.900]   online for public's view, and there is no requirement
[03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:51.700]   to prepare the, you know, SAC's report or the full budget
[03:00:51.700 --> 03:00:54.400]   report at this time for 45-day revised.
[03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:57.500]   So, it's just the data that we are going to show you
[03:00:57.500 --> 03:00:59.000]   the change in the budget.
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:05.900]   As the board may recall that in the, when the board approved
[03:01:05.900 --> 03:01:09.700]   the budget in June, it was based on the January budget
[03:01:09.700 --> 03:01:14.200]   proposal, and since then, the state enacted the budget
[03:01:14.200 --> 03:01:19.700]   with the slightly higher COLA for 20-25 and 25-26 year,
[03:01:19.700 --> 03:01:23.600]   and there is a slight decline in COLA for 26-27 year.
[03:01:23.600 --> 03:01:27.100]   Overall, combining three years, our districts is going
[03:01:27.100 --> 03:01:33.300]   to expect to have a higher revenue by over $4 million
[03:01:33.300 --> 03:01:39.800]   for three years, and just for 20-25 or $1 million.
[03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:42.500]   And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Ms. Hogan.
[03:01:43.500 --> 03:01:47.500]   >> Thank you, Ms. Bolzara.
[03:01:47.500 --> 03:01:50.600]   So, school services, every July does an enacted budget
[03:01:50.600 --> 03:01:54.000]   workshop in which they share key slides that as a fiscal
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.600]   team, we believe are worthy of sharing with the board
[03:01:56.600 --> 03:01:59.600]   and the public, especially since the budget is considered
[03:01:59.600 --> 03:02:03.000]   fluid and at any time may change based on the economic
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:04.200]   status of the state.
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:09.100]   So, this slide in front of you provides us with the enacted
[03:02:09.100 --> 03:02:13.600]   LCFF funding factors per student grade span based on funding
[03:02:13.600 --> 03:02:18.100]   which increases by an average of $114 per grade span.
[03:02:18.100 --> 03:02:21.400]   This increase is based on the cost of living as we know
[03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:26.000]   COLA, 1.07%, and then we also receive additional grade
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:29.800]   span funding for students in TK through third grade
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:32.800]   and those in 9 through 12, as well as for students
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:34.500]   that are considered unduplicated.
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:39.400]   The next few slides I will be sharing with the board will
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:43.100]   provide information on how the enacted budget addresses
[03:02:43.100 --> 03:02:46.400]   the contribution maneuver discussion that was taking
[03:02:46.400 --> 03:02:48.700]   place prior to budget adoption.
[03:02:48.700 --> 03:02:52.200]   As you may recall, there was a lot of talk regarding
[03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:56.300]   Proposition 98 as Governor Newsom was providing a maneuver
[03:02:56.300 --> 03:03:00.200]   that would have had a negative impact on the future funding.
[03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:04.500]   It would have lowered the minimum guarantee if implemented
[03:03:04.500 --> 03:03:08.700]   as you see here with the blue line showing less revenue
[03:03:08.700 --> 03:03:13.500]   than the guaranteed for $23.24 if the maneuver would have
[03:03:13.500 --> 03:03:15.100]   been part of this enacted budget.
[03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:18.900]   However, due to the advocacy of many stakeholders,
[03:03:18.900 --> 03:03:22.600]   a compromise was reached which included the suspension
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:26.100]   of Prop 98 with the repayment in future years.
[03:03:26.100 --> 03:03:31.300]   And here you're able to see some of those changes,
[03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:32.600]   those compromises there.
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:36.800]   The decision to set Prop 98 based at a higher level
[03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:45.600]   in 2223 increases the $23.24 guarantee to $106.8 billion.
[03:03:45.600 --> 03:03:49.600]   However, available state revenues are insufficient
[03:03:49.600 --> 03:03:52.400]   to meet this requirement in 2324.
[03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:56.800]   As a result, the state leaders decided to suspend
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:04:02.200]   Prop 98 guarantee and set the funding level at $98.5 billion
[03:04:02.500 --> 03:04:04.000]   in 2324.
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:07.300]   Suspending the guarantee is allowed under the state
[03:04:07.300 --> 03:04:09.700]   Constitution for the particular purpose.
[03:04:09.700 --> 03:04:14.800]   This is the third time since the enactment of Prop 98
[03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:18.400]   that the guaranteed has actually been suspended
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:20.200]   when it was enacted in 1988.
[03:04:20.200 --> 03:04:25.300]   The budget also includes deferrals as a way of managing
[03:04:25.300 --> 03:04:28.800]   the shortfall which basically moves funding which should
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:33.100]   have been received this June of 2024 to July of 2024
[03:04:33.100 --> 03:04:36.000]   and it will be the same for next year in 2025.
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:40.300]   As noted here, districts and charters may be exempt
[03:04:40.300 --> 03:04:43.600]   if the deferral posed a cash flow concerned to meet
[03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:47.800]   the obligations which is why cash on hand through reserves
[03:04:47.800 --> 03:04:49.300]   is important for districts.
[03:04:49.300 --> 03:04:53.700]   OUSD will be able to meet its obligations despite
[03:04:53.700 --> 03:04:54.600]   these deferrals.
[03:04:56.400 --> 03:05:00.000]   And then finally, in addition to the suspension of Prop 98
[03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:04.200]   deferrals and other adjustments, there is a requirement
[03:05:04.200 --> 03:05:07.500]   to address the shortfall through withdrawals and this
[03:05:07.500 --> 03:05:12.300]   is triggered by the Prop 98 minimum guarantee in 2324.
[03:05:12.300 --> 03:05:15.700]   As required by the state Constitution, the governor
[03:05:15.700 --> 03:05:19.600]   signed a proclamation on June 26 declaring a budget
[03:05:19.600 --> 03:05:23.100]   emergency in order to allow the withdrawal from the budget
[03:05:23.100 --> 03:05:27.200]   stabilization account which we know as the rainy day account.
[03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:30.500]   So while all of these adjustments were made to present
[03:05:30.500 --> 03:05:34.600]   a favorable outcome for education, it is still important
[03:05:34.600 --> 03:05:36.300]   that we continue to monitor.
[03:05:36.300 --> 03:05:41.400]   Moving on over the last couple of years, there has been
[03:05:41.400 --> 03:05:45.300]   a local reserve cap based on the fact that Proposition 98
[03:05:45.300 --> 03:05:50.400]   reserves was at least 3% or higher than the K-12 guarantee
[03:05:51.100 --> 03:05:52.300]   which you see here.
[03:05:52.300 --> 03:05:56.300]   The depletion though, as we just discussed and depleting
[03:05:56.300 --> 03:06:01.000]   from the rainy day there, in 2324 makes the cap on local
[03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:05.900]   reserves and operative for the 2425 with only a projection
[03:06:05.900 --> 03:06:07.900]   of $1.2 billion in reserve.
[03:06:07.900 --> 03:06:11.800]   This information came about after budget adoption.
[03:06:11.800 --> 03:06:15.900]   So there is no need to adjust or revoke the resolution of
[03:06:15.900 --> 03:06:19.900]   committed funds that OUSD has because at the time of the
[03:06:19.900 --> 03:06:24.300]   budget adoption, the cap on the local reserves was still
[03:06:24.300 --> 03:06:25.000]   in place.
[03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:30.600]   California continues to monitor enrollment trends being
[03:06:30.600 --> 03:06:34.200]   that education is funded by our average daily attendance.
[03:06:34.200 --> 03:06:37.700]   Therefore, if less students are enrolled, we have less
[03:06:37.700 --> 03:06:38.400]   attendance.
[03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:41.800]   As you see here, the enrollment trend continues to move
[03:06:41.800 --> 03:06:45.700]   downward and that is due to many factors including the cost
[03:06:45.700 --> 03:06:48.500]   of living in California and lower birth rates.
[03:06:48.700 --> 03:06:53.600]   OUSD is no different from the state.
[03:06:53.600 --> 03:06:57.600]   Thanks to our data team, they created a similar chart using
[03:06:57.600 --> 03:06:59.200]   OUSD enrollment data.
[03:06:59.200 --> 03:07:03.500]   So the linear regression bars in the light orange provide a
[03:07:03.500 --> 03:07:07.800]   more optimistic outlook for OUSD's future because the year
[03:07:07.800 --> 03:07:11.800]   over year decline is based on simple attrition of cohorts.
[03:07:11.800 --> 03:07:16.700]   The exponential smoothing in the light green bars shows what
[03:07:16.700 --> 03:07:20.000]   might be more realistic as they follow the current downward
[03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:23.100]   trend more closely in alignment with the state.
[03:07:23.100 --> 03:07:26.300]   Again, this is something that we will continue to monitor.
[03:07:26.300 --> 03:07:31.700]   I will turn it back to Miss Boussara who will share with you
[03:07:31.700 --> 03:07:34.500]   the next steps regarding the budget monitoring and reporting.
[03:07:34.500 --> 03:07:39.900]   Thank you again.
[03:07:42.700 --> 03:07:46.700]   So currently our fiscal team and all our team is working
[03:07:46.700 --> 03:07:52.100]   diligently to close our 23-24 year books and in preparation
[03:07:52.100 --> 03:07:55.900]   for our annual actuals that we will be presenting in September
[03:07:55.900 --> 03:07:56.700]   board meeting.
[03:07:56.700 --> 03:08:02.000]   And that report will also include the school site carryover,
[03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:06.900]   donation carryover if any, and we will also update the budget
[03:08:06.900 --> 03:08:08.600]   to what I presented just earlier.
[03:08:08.600 --> 03:08:12.300]   And in the meantime, we are also working with executive
[03:08:12.300 --> 03:08:16.100]   revenue in collaboration with educational services, human
[03:08:16.100 --> 03:08:19.900]   resources, and the fiscal team we are going to be working on
[03:08:19.900 --> 03:08:24.500]   and looking at a lot of data and working on revenue enhancement,
[03:08:24.500 --> 03:08:28.900]   how to expenditure reductions and one-time revenues if any.
[03:08:28.900 --> 03:08:33.200]   So we are going to be also monitoring enrollment when
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:37.000]   students are returning next week and focusing on average
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:38.100]   daily attendance.
[03:08:38.900 --> 03:08:43.200]   Also including all those data we'll be presenting by December
[03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:44.700]   in our first income report.
[03:08:44.700 --> 03:08:46.200]   And thank you so much.
[03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:48.900]   And if you have any questions, we are happy to answer.
[03:08:48.900 --> 03:08:52.900]   Thank you both so much for the presentation.
[03:08:52.900 --> 03:08:58.700]   I really liked what Miss Hulking said in the chart as they're
[03:08:58.700 --> 03:09:05.100]   on the different slide sharing the state of California and how
[03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:09.600]   orange unified is okay because we have enough in our reserves.
[03:09:09.600 --> 03:09:14.300]   But looking at the projection of the amount of students will
[03:09:14.300 --> 03:09:17.300]   potentially have in the future, knowing that there's going to
[03:09:17.300 --> 03:09:18.900]   be a decline in our budget.
[03:09:18.900 --> 03:09:22.700]   What else are we doing to prepare and uphold a lot of the
[03:09:22.700 --> 03:09:23.800]   programs that we have?
[03:09:23.800 --> 03:09:27.300]   We don't want to make cuts with programming or anything like
[03:09:27.300 --> 03:09:27.500]   that.
[03:09:27.500 --> 03:09:32.300]   So are there discussions about how to recoup some of that
[03:09:32.400 --> 03:09:36.000]   funding or grant applications?
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:40.600]   As Miss Boussara stated, there are the five year stabilization
[03:09:40.600 --> 03:09:44.000]   plan in collaboration with our different divisions in planning
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:46.700]   and looking at where are areas that we can and what is some
[03:09:46.700 --> 03:09:49.300]   grants, some grants that we have in order to be able to support
[03:09:49.300 --> 03:09:50.100]   those programs.
[03:09:50.100 --> 03:09:52.100]   Constantly monitoring that.
[03:09:52.100 --> 03:09:53.800]   Thank you.
[03:09:53.800 --> 03:09:56.100]   Are there additional questions or comments from the board?
[03:10:01.300 --> 03:10:02.200]   Okay, thank you.
[03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:02.800]   Thank you.
[03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:07.700]   Thank you.
[03:10:07.700 --> 03:10:14.500]   A, B, the smart plan, school modernization and renovation
[03:10:14.500 --> 03:10:17.600]   for tomorrow plan and surplus property with 711 committee
[03:10:17.600 --> 03:10:18.200]   updates.
[03:10:18.200 --> 03:10:20.300]   So me again.
[03:10:20.300 --> 03:10:30.200]   So today is day 34 for me and I have to say that it's been
[03:10:30.200 --> 03:10:33.900]   exciting getting up to speed on all the projects and tasks
[03:10:33.900 --> 03:10:38.000]   orange unified is engaged in and continuing to engage in with
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:41.300]   the community to help provide improved facilities for our
[03:10:41.300 --> 03:10:42.000]   students.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:45.800]   We saw an example of that with an update regarding the next
[03:10:45.800 --> 03:10:47.200]   phase of measure s.
[03:10:47.200 --> 03:10:51.200]   I also have gone back and reviewed some of the previous
[03:10:51.200 --> 03:10:55.000]   board meetings specifically the May 9th and had many one on
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.200]   one team meetings to get up to speed.
[03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:01.000]   Tonight I want to provide an update based on the information
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:04.400]   gathered and next steps needed for effective implementation
[03:11:04.400 --> 03:11:07.600]   of both the school modernization and renovation for tomorrow
[03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:10.600]   project and the 711 committee process.
[03:11:10.600 --> 03:11:15.900]   Part of merging these two topics together is because this 711
[03:11:15.900 --> 03:11:19.500]   committee is part of some of the decisions that may impact the
[03:11:19.500 --> 03:11:20.400]   smart project.
[03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:26.500]   So I must credit Mr. Rivera for his creative thinking and
[03:11:26.500 --> 03:11:31.600]   connection of the acronyms as smart with his idea smart which
[03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:35.500]   stands for school modernization and renovation for tomorrow
[03:11:35.500 --> 03:11:40.100]   has many ideas and resources and where the overarching goal is
[03:11:40.100 --> 03:11:43.200]   to improve our facilities and student learning environments.
[03:11:43.200 --> 03:11:47.800]   Great questions and comments were shared during the May 9th
[03:11:47.800 --> 03:11:52.500]   presentation that made our team reflect and collaborate on all
[03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:55.000]   that is needed to bring these action items.
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:02.600]   As part of that collaboration we have identified key ideas
[03:12:02.600 --> 03:12:07.900]   for the plan surplus property 711 committee project list
[03:12:07.900 --> 03:12:10.600]   which includes the deferred maintenance and the facilities
[03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:15.300]   master plan energy management plan and funding specifically
[03:12:15.300 --> 03:12:17.800]   maximizing state modernization funding.
[03:12:17.800 --> 03:12:22.800]   Some of these ideas require us working simultaneously on other
[03:12:22.800 --> 03:12:27.300]   ideas as we're waiting for results by merging these ideas
[03:12:27.300 --> 03:12:30.900]   under smart we can bring a holistic view to the district's
[03:12:30.900 --> 03:12:34.300]   overall facility needs and throughout the year provide
[03:12:34.300 --> 03:12:38.300]   updates to the board with actionable recommendations.
[03:12:38.300 --> 03:12:42.700]   Tonight I'm here to update progress and next steps needed
[03:12:42.700 --> 03:12:47.200]   for two ideas dependent on each other surplus property and
[03:12:47.200 --> 03:12:51.400]   711 committee while the other ideas are also dependent on
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:55.500]   these two topics we need to conduct a deeper dive to come
[03:12:55.500 --> 03:12:59.400]   back to the board with detailed updates and believe that the
[03:12:59.400 --> 03:13:02.800]   most efficient way to accomplish the needs is to work in
[03:13:02.800 --> 03:13:07.500]   phases while some phases will overlap as you will hear today
[03:13:07.500 --> 03:13:10.300]   additional and ongoing research is needed.
[03:13:10.300 --> 03:13:16.900]   At the May 9th meeting there were great comments and questions
[03:13:16.900 --> 03:13:20.900]   regarding the 711 process requirements role and support
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:24.500]   that will be offered to the committee those comments and
[03:13:24.500 --> 03:13:27.700]   questions led me to meet with staff to see where they were
[03:13:27.700 --> 03:13:33.000]   with this process. As you see on the slide at code 17390
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:37.400]   clearly defines the role and purpose of this committee which
[03:13:37.400 --> 03:13:41.400]   for example includes reviewing the projected school enrollment
[03:13:41.400 --> 03:13:45.200]   and other data as provided by the district to determine the
[03:13:45.200 --> 03:13:50.200]   amount of surplus and real property establishing a priority
[03:13:50.200 --> 03:13:56.200]   list use or surplus space and real property make a determination
[03:13:56.200 --> 03:14:00.400]   of the limits of tolerance and use of space and real property
[03:14:00.400 --> 03:14:02.600]   in order to make the recommendation to the board.
[03:14:02.600 --> 03:14:09.300]   Well, it may sound simple. Let me use this map of LaVita to
[03:14:09.300 --> 03:14:13.300]   share some of the conversations we had regarding whether we've
[03:14:13.300 --> 03:14:17.300]   felt fully prepared to provide the necessary information to
[03:14:17.300 --> 03:14:19.500]   the 711 committee members to review.
[03:14:20.500 --> 03:14:24.800]   So here you see in this picture of LaVita an area potential
[03:14:24.800 --> 03:14:29.800]   surplus that is bordered by the orange line. It is approximately
[03:14:29.800 --> 03:14:37.500]   6.8 acres 665 wide by 445 deep and leaves 10 acres for the
[03:14:37.500 --> 03:14:41.600]   school as generally recommended by the California Department
[03:14:41.600 --> 03:14:44.900]   of Education for a 500 student elementary school.
[03:14:45.900 --> 03:14:49.200]   We are currently gathering proposals from architectural
[03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:53.000]   firms to provide a design showing how to accommodate to meet
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:57.200]   the CDE recommended hardscape and fill space and determine
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:15:00.000]   the potential area of surplus property available.
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:04.400]   We also need to see if the enrollment projections support
[03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:08.800]   the number of portables currently on the list on the site as
[03:15:08.800 --> 03:15:13.200]   fewer portables equal more hardscape space area.
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:16.900]   Now these are some of the questions and information that staff
[03:15:16.900 --> 03:15:20.200]   needed more time to work on to provide thorough data for the
[03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:24.600]   board and the committee. The same detailed process would also
[03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:28.300]   need to be done for other surplus properties. Our goal
[03:15:28.300 --> 03:15:31.800]   overall that while some of the surplus work is being completed,
[03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:36.200]   we will finalize the recruitment of the 711 committee and come
[03:15:36.200 --> 03:15:39.700]   back to the board with the recommendation of which property
[03:15:39.700 --> 03:15:42.600]   or properties we want to look at first.
[03:15:43.300 --> 03:15:49.900]   We also in front of you you have copies of the revised application
[03:15:49.900 --> 03:15:53.800]   both in English and in Spanish that was provided along with
[03:15:53.800 --> 03:15:57.600]   this presentation. This application came about based on
[03:15:57.600 --> 03:16:01.600]   comments from the board that took that were during the May 9th
[03:16:01.600 --> 03:16:06.100]   meeting conversations with staff regarding the vetting to select
[03:16:06.100 --> 03:16:11.100]   members for the committee and with the support of legal as
[03:16:11.100 --> 03:16:14.000]   well as what has been done in the past in addition to
[03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:17.600]   conversations with other districts. It is in alignment
[03:16:17.600 --> 03:16:21.700]   with the ed code requirements. We would like to move forward
[03:16:21.700 --> 03:16:25.500]   with this application once we are ready by first bringing the
[03:16:25.500 --> 03:16:30.500]   board committee bylaws for approval. Then reaching out to
[03:16:30.500 --> 03:16:34.400]   those who applied to ask that they please fill out this new
[03:16:34.400 --> 03:16:37.600]   application and confirm that they are still interested.
[03:16:38.400 --> 03:16:41.800]   We would also open the window for additional applicants who may
[03:16:41.800 --> 03:16:46.700]   be interested. Some of the revisions include simplified
[03:16:46.700 --> 03:16:51.000]   information separate from the application. Since the code
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:55.400]   requires representation of each of the categories, we added
[03:16:55.400 --> 03:16:58.500]   a question to meet the social ethnic composition of the
[03:16:58.500 --> 03:17:03.100]   district which is optional for the candidates. Applicants can
[03:17:03.100 --> 03:17:07.900]   represent more than one category. Because the code is silent
[03:17:07.900 --> 03:17:11.200]   regarding whether the applicant needs to live in the boundary
[03:17:11.200 --> 03:17:14.700]   if they represent the category, we have actually asked the
[03:17:14.700 --> 03:17:18.800]   question. Our goal is to get a better understanding if the
[03:17:18.800 --> 03:17:22.100]   applicant is directly or indirectly connected to the
[03:17:22.100 --> 03:17:26.400]   district. And finally a signature acknowledging the information
[03:17:26.400 --> 03:17:28.600]   is true to the best of their knowledge.
[03:17:28.600 --> 03:17:34.400]   Additionally, we confirmed with legal that the committee can
[03:17:34.400 --> 03:17:38.400]   serve as an ongoing committee if it continues to meet the member
[03:17:38.400 --> 03:17:43.000]   requirements. Also, the board can appoint new members if after
[03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:46.900]   making a recommendation on a certain property. Some members
[03:17:46.900 --> 03:17:53.900]   decide that they no longer want to participate and or if the
[03:17:53.900 --> 03:17:56.400]   board decides that they want to appoint members that are more
[03:17:56.400 --> 03:18:00.700]   geographically connected to the surplus property. This is
[03:18:00.700 --> 03:18:04.800]   allowable because the committee is strictly advisory. Not
[03:18:04.800 --> 03:18:10.500]   minding as you see here with code 17388. So for now, we want
[03:18:10.500 --> 03:18:13.800]   to make sure that the board is comfortable with the application.
[03:18:13.800 --> 03:18:18.300]   We would keep the board informed for periodic updates of when
[03:18:18.300 --> 03:18:21.400]   we are ready to engage in the recruitment again and use
[03:18:21.400 --> 03:18:24.700]   multiple avenues of outreach, which will include the support
[03:18:24.700 --> 03:18:28.500]   of our communications departments and our school sites. Once
[03:18:28.500 --> 03:18:31.500]   that process is over, we will bring you a recommendation of
[03:18:31.500 --> 03:18:34.700]   the community members who will represent the seven criteria
[03:18:34.700 --> 03:18:39.300]   required with the resolution of outlining the process. Based
[03:18:39.300 --> 03:18:42.700]   on what we heard, priority would be given to applicants who
[03:18:42.700 --> 03:18:46.300]   reside in the district and have a personal stake in the
[03:18:46.300 --> 03:18:49.500]   district with the goal of covering the overall composition
[03:18:49.500 --> 03:18:53.100]   of the district. Applicants would remain on file to be
[03:18:53.100 --> 03:18:57.900]   reviewed if needed or in case of a vacancy as all documents
[03:18:57.900 --> 03:19:00.900]   pertaining to the committee are subject to the Public Records
[03:19:00.900 --> 03:19:04.500]   Act. And that concludes the update.
[03:19:04.500 --> 03:19:09.100]   Thank you very much. I was really pleased to see the
[03:19:09.100 --> 03:19:14.000]   updated application in both languages and fully integrated
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:18.600]   in a lot of the feedback that we had. And also the plan of
[03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:23.400]   distribution and recruitment, including our DLAC and ELAC
[03:19:23.500 --> 03:19:28.200]   groups, so that we can really get a wide range of families
[03:19:28.200 --> 03:19:30.400]   to be able to be represented on this committee.
[03:19:30.400 --> 03:19:34.300]   Any other comments or questions?
[03:19:34.300 --> 03:19:39.300]   Trustee Erickson. Sure. First of all, I just want to thank
[03:19:39.300 --> 03:19:44.500]   you and I like how you talked about working in phases and
[03:19:44.500 --> 03:19:48.500]   also really front loading all these answers to questions
[03:19:48.500 --> 03:19:51.500]   before we dive into something. I think that's really important
[03:19:51.500 --> 03:19:55.500]   and I really appreciate that with your planning. You
[03:19:55.500 --> 03:20:00.200]   are asking these questions, but you're also acting quickly
[03:20:00.200 --> 03:20:03.200]   to answer a lot of these questions. I just really
[03:20:03.200 --> 03:20:06.200]   appreciate that. I think in terms of looking at something
[03:20:06.200 --> 03:20:11.200]   like Lovita, I feel it's important that we really perfect
[03:20:11.200 --> 03:20:14.600]   the process and we don't go out and do, you know, five of
[03:20:14.600 --> 03:20:18.000]   these at once, but we really focus on one, make sure that
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:23.000]   we do it absolutely correctly and then we can replicate
[03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:25.600]   that later learning from whatever mistakes we make.
[03:20:25.600 --> 03:20:28.200]   So I do appreciate that and I sense that that's kind of
[03:20:28.200 --> 03:20:31.300]   where we're going. So thank you for that. Thank you. And
[03:20:31.300 --> 03:20:33.400]   that is our goal. Thank you.
[03:20:33.400 --> 03:20:40.100]   Thank you. First of all, I want to thank you so much for
[03:20:40.100 --> 03:20:42.700]   taking a look at the last meeting because that was really
[03:20:42.700 --> 03:20:45.500]   telling because we asked a lot of questions and so I say
[03:20:45.500 --> 03:20:48.400]   that you incorporated a lot of our concerns into this new
[03:20:48.400 --> 03:20:52.400]   one. So thank you for that. I really think that was
[03:20:52.400 --> 03:20:56.000]   important. And I just also want to thank you too. I had a
[03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:59.100]   couple of questions and you were able to answer them for
[03:20:59.100 --> 03:21:02.400]   me prior to this and I want to incorporate some of them
[03:21:02.400 --> 03:21:06.800]   into the application as well. So I just want to say
[03:21:06.800 --> 03:21:09.200]   thank you and thank you for making the font size bigger
[03:21:09.200 --> 03:21:12.000]   on the presentation too because I had asked for that.
[03:21:14.900 --> 03:21:15.900]   Thank you.
[03:21:15.900 --> 03:21:22.500]   Thank you. Thank you.
[03:21:22.500 --> 03:21:27.300]   Chelsea Erickson. We have a public comment for this next
[03:21:27.300 --> 03:21:29.800]   item. We do. John Stanks.
[03:21:29.800 --> 03:21:40.200]   Didn't think I'd be the only one that agenda item comment
[03:21:40.200 --> 03:21:43.600]   tonight. Anyway, I'm a parent taxpayer homeowner in the
[03:21:43.600 --> 03:21:46.100]   warrant unified area. I'm glad I'm taking some time to go
[03:21:46.100 --> 03:21:49.800]   over to board policies tonight. I think it's been time to
[03:21:49.800 --> 03:21:51.900]   do that. I'm going to speak really quickly about the
[03:21:51.900 --> 03:21:55.000]   attorney policy that you haven't. I want to frame this
[03:21:55.000 --> 03:21:57.900]   with the attorney represents the district themselves and
[03:21:57.900 --> 03:22:01.500]   not the individual board members and you know, I work a
[03:22:01.500 --> 03:22:04.900]   lot with attorneys in my daily life and I go through a
[03:22:04.900 --> 03:22:07.600]   mantra that if I cannot convince my internal counsel
[03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:10.300]   that what I'm doing is correct, an opposing counsel is
[03:22:10.300 --> 03:22:13.200]   going to eat me alive. So over the last year, I've seen
[03:22:13.200 --> 03:22:16.100]   the board members and I'm happy to have access to the
[03:22:16.100 --> 03:22:19.200]   attorneys here. Weaponized in a way I've just never seen
[03:22:19.200 --> 03:22:22.400]   before in public agency. I'm glad that our worst defender
[03:22:22.400 --> 03:22:25.700]   isn't here to do this anymore. But you know, the point I
[03:22:25.700 --> 03:22:28.700]   want to make is I think all of our board members should
[03:22:28.700 --> 03:22:32.000]   have the equal authority to ask questions of the school
[03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:35.600]   district's attorney when we're here in this meeting running
[03:22:35.600 --> 03:22:38.300]   through the board president the way it has been before. I
[03:22:38.300 --> 03:22:41.000]   find it's back when it doesn't. That's just not the way I
[03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:43.100]   just the way that you can ask your superintendent a
[03:22:43.100 --> 03:22:45.300]   question. I think anybody up here should go and ask your
[03:22:45.300 --> 03:22:48.700]   attorney your question. If it's a legal, it's a legitimate
[03:22:48.700 --> 03:22:51.400]   legal question. There's legal consequences of a board
[03:22:51.400 --> 03:22:53.400]   action. You know, you all need to know that so you can make
[03:22:53.400 --> 03:22:55.900]   an informed decision moving forward. The attorney's job
[03:22:55.900 --> 03:22:58.700]   is to help protect the district. The board, of
[03:22:58.700 --> 03:23:01.600]   course, it's free to overrule and ignore the advice that
[03:23:01.600 --> 03:23:03.900]   you're given here, but I think you just all need to know
[03:23:03.900 --> 03:23:07.500]   what the risks are. The taxpayers pay a lot of money
[03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:09.800]   for an attorney to sit in this room and I just feel
[03:23:09.800 --> 03:23:11.800]   like we're watching the last year and a half of meetings
[03:23:11.800 --> 03:23:14.400]   here. We can use that money a little more wisely in this
[03:23:14.400 --> 03:23:16.800]   boardroom. That's all I have tonight. Thank you very much.
[03:23:16.800 --> 03:23:28.500]   Thank you. This is the proposed revisions to board
[03:23:28.500 --> 03:23:31.700]   policies and bylaws the first reading. So the purpose of
[03:23:31.700 --> 03:23:36.200]   tonight is to review the bylaws that are listed on the
[03:23:36.200 --> 03:23:41.400]   agenda. Add any comments, revisions to then propose
[03:23:41.400 --> 03:23:45.000]   again for a final approval reading at the next meeting.
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:52.500]   Are there any questions on this specific one? I mean, I
[03:23:52.500 --> 03:23:55.800]   have comments, but I want a few of them so I don't know
[03:23:55.800 --> 03:23:59.000]   how you want to take that. I think we want to go in at a
[03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:04.300]   time. Are there any additional comments from other board
[03:24:04.300 --> 03:24:09.500]   members or a preference to take one at a time or just
[03:24:09.500 --> 03:24:11.700]   have Trustee Erickson share her comments?
[03:24:11.700 --> 03:24:20.500]   Okay, we'll take one policy at a time or just let us know
[03:24:20.500 --> 03:24:23.600]   which one you're commenting on. Okay, what have I went
[03:24:23.600 --> 03:24:28.200]   through all of them? So I do have some suggestions, I
[03:24:28.200 --> 03:24:31.500]   guess for some of them, but just as a general rule, I
[03:24:31.500 --> 03:24:36.000]   wanted to comment and clarify for the board and for the
[03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:41.200]   public that these revisions are brought to us really to
[03:24:41.200 --> 03:24:45.800]   address changes in the law to sort of sort of tighten
[03:24:45.800 --> 03:24:48.900]   things up as they come along. Is that right?
[03:24:48.900 --> 03:24:55.400]   And so not every board bylaw is in this packet and I do
[03:24:55.400 --> 03:24:59.400]   think that we as a board have an obligation to go through
[03:24:59.400 --> 03:25:04.200]   our board bylaws, even ones that aren't in this packet
[03:25:04.200 --> 03:25:07.600]   provision because they may not have a change in the law,
[03:25:07.600 --> 03:25:11.400]   but we as a board may believe that we should revisit our
[03:25:11.400 --> 03:25:16.000]   bylaws and so I would like to see that happen. I came up
[03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:18.600]   with three of them that I think we could revisit and that
[03:25:18.600 --> 03:25:21.600]   would be or agendize had a future date and that would
[03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:31.700]   be 9322 a 9200 and 9150 specifically having to do with
[03:25:31.700 --> 03:25:37.600]   things like last year we came across an issue where a trustee
[03:25:37.600 --> 03:25:41.200]   was using the official logo for private purposes and we
[03:25:41.200 --> 03:25:45.600]   didn't have a policy on it and so then it just kind of
[03:25:45.600 --> 03:25:48.800]   opened it up as a free for all. I think that we need to look
[03:25:48.800 --> 03:25:52.500]   into that and we need to create policy for that and that
[03:25:52.500 --> 03:25:55.100]   isn't necessarily pulled because there hasn't been a
[03:25:55.100 --> 03:25:58.300]   change in the law. So I don't know how we want to go about
[03:25:58.300 --> 03:26:01.600]   doing that, but I do think that we need to revisit particularly
[03:26:01.600 --> 03:26:04.400]   the board bylaws because those are really how we function
[03:26:04.400 --> 03:26:12.100]   as a board. The other one was the other two you can take a
[03:26:12.100 --> 03:26:19.500]   look at one is the student board member policy and 9322 a I
[03:26:19.500 --> 03:26:21.700]   can't remember what the other one was, but those are three
[03:26:21.700 --> 03:26:24.300]   that I thought we might want to pull in the future. I'm not
[03:26:24.300 --> 03:26:28.900]   going to address them because they're not agendize, but on
[03:26:28.900 --> 03:26:40.800]   the attorney one, the 9124 a I did want to consider in the
[03:26:40.800 --> 03:26:45.200]   last paragraph it says individual board members other than
[03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:48.300]   the board president may not seek advice from the district
[03:26:48.300 --> 03:26:51.700]   legal council on matters of district business unless so
[03:26:51.700 --> 03:26:57.800]   authorized by the majority of the board in open session that
[03:26:57.800 --> 03:27:03.900]   that kind of addresses exactly what the speaker said. Obviously
[03:27:03.900 --> 03:27:06.900]   individual board members in an open session meeting can talk
[03:27:06.900 --> 03:27:11.600]   to council in open session and so that paragraph to me even
[03:27:11.600 --> 03:27:15.200]   though it may be standard language is confusing and I think
[03:27:15.200 --> 03:27:19.600]   we might want to clarify that. I'm assuming that that means
[03:27:19.800 --> 03:27:25.000]   outside the presence of the public and in private or whatever
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:29.400]   that only the board president can get advice from district
[03:27:29.400 --> 03:27:33.700]   council, district legal council. So I think we need some
[03:27:33.700 --> 03:27:37.200]   clarification on that and I also think that it would be good
[03:27:37.200 --> 03:27:41.100]   to add language to that that says individual board members
[03:27:41.100 --> 03:27:46.000]   other than the board president and then I would say or the
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:51.000]   board presidents presidents as a meeting so that you could if
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:53.400]   somebody came to you with a question and they said, you
[03:27:53.400 --> 03:27:55.500]   know, we want to ask this particular question, but you
[03:27:55.500 --> 03:27:59.100]   didn't have time to ask it that you could designate another
[03:27:59.100 --> 03:28:01.800]   board member to ask that particular question on a case
[03:28:01.800 --> 03:28:07.900]   by case basis. So that was just one clarification. I thought
[03:28:07.900 --> 03:28:11.300]   might be important since this is a first read.
[03:28:14.800 --> 03:28:17.800]   So we can move and be voting on it now but
[03:28:17.800 --> 03:28:25.100]   on 9 3 2 0.
[03:28:25.100 --> 03:28:34.400]   I know that that we added this language.
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:41.800]   On to the board bylaw that's 9 3 2 3.2 C but I think that we
[03:28:41.800 --> 03:28:46.400]   need to add in this language is a new legislation that talks
[03:28:46.400 --> 03:28:50.900]   about that a special meeting cannot be called for the
[03:28:50.900 --> 03:28:54.600]   purpose of terminating without cause the superintendent or
[03:28:54.600 --> 03:28:59.200]   assistant superintendent. So we talk a lot about what we can
[03:28:59.200 --> 03:29:03.400]   do in these meetings and so I do think that we should add that
[03:29:03.400 --> 03:29:06.300]   clarification in this and so
[03:29:06.300 --> 03:29:11.600]   even though it is in another bylaw, I also think it's important
[03:29:11.600 --> 03:29:16.200]   to add it to this since we put in this bylaw.
[03:29:16.200 --> 03:29:22.900]   However, we have in this existing bylaw that a special
[03:29:22.900 --> 03:29:25.300]   meeting shall not be called regarding the salary salary
[03:29:25.300 --> 03:29:28.400]   schedule or other compensation of the superintendent, assistant
[03:29:28.400 --> 03:29:30.900]   superintendent or other management employee. I think
[03:29:30.900 --> 03:29:34.900]   we should add to that that any action to terminate without
[03:29:34.900 --> 03:29:38.300]   cause the superintendent or assistant superintendent may
[03:29:38.300 --> 03:29:40.600]   only take place at a regular board meeting.
[03:29:41.600 --> 03:29:44.600]   And following an election where one or more board members
[03:29:44.600 --> 03:29:48.200]   are elected or recalled, the board must wait 30 days after
[03:29:48.200 --> 03:29:51.700]   the first meeting of the new board. And I think we should
[03:29:51.700 --> 03:29:58.300]   incorporate that into 93 20 and it would be under the regular
[03:29:58.300 --> 03:29:59.900]   regular meetings heading.
[03:29:59.900 --> 03:30:00.900]   Okay.
[03:30:00.900 --> 03:30:13.900]   One more.
[03:30:13.900 --> 03:30:16.900]   93 23.2.
[03:30:16.900 --> 03:30:24.900]   Actions of the board. The question I have.
[03:30:25.900 --> 03:30:26.900]   Hold on.
[03:30:26.900 --> 03:30:43.900]   It could it could apply to that one or could just apply to 93
[03:30:43.900 --> 03:30:44.900]   23.2.
[03:30:44.900 --> 03:30:48.900]   I'm sorry, actually.
[03:30:48.900 --> 03:30:53.900]   Yeah, it would be 93 23.2 a actions by the board.
[03:30:54.900 --> 03:30:57.900]   And then it's titled restrictions on board actions.
[03:30:57.900 --> 03:31:00.900]   I know a lot of these are specific to.
[03:31:00.900 --> 03:31:05.900]   Our citing code, but my question is.
[03:31:05.900 --> 03:31:10.900]   If we as a board would like to do something like and hear me
[03:31:10.900 --> 03:31:11.900]   out as an example.
[03:31:11.900 --> 03:31:17.900]   That we want to require a two thirds vote of the board.
[03:31:18.900 --> 03:31:23.900]   If the board brought or was voting on a licensing agreement
[03:31:23.900 --> 03:31:26.900]   that was more than four years.
[03:31:26.900 --> 03:31:31.900]   Let's say we could require as a board, I believe if I'm not
[03:31:31.900 --> 03:31:34.900]   mistaken that that be a super majority of the board that has
[03:31:34.900 --> 03:31:38.900]   to vote on that because that is in essence.
[03:31:38.900 --> 03:31:43.900]   For more intensive purposes, even if it's not called a license,
[03:31:43.900 --> 03:31:47.900]   it's still like a lease and it binds us so that for right now,
[03:31:47.900 --> 03:31:51.900]   we have a 25 year license agreement that is binding us and
[03:31:51.900 --> 03:31:55.900]   diminishing our property value.
[03:31:55.900 --> 03:31:58.900]   And yet it only took a four to three vote.
[03:31:58.900 --> 03:32:02.900]   I think that we need to revisit that so that we don't bind.
[03:32:02.900 --> 03:32:08.900]   We don't bind up our property without a super majority of the
[03:32:08.900 --> 03:32:09.900]   board supporting that.
[03:32:09.900 --> 03:32:14.900]   So that would be something I think we should add to 93 23.2 a.
[03:32:15.900 --> 03:32:18.900]   I think that's kind of a new situation.
[03:32:18.900 --> 03:32:21.900]   We haven't had that situation before where we've called, you
[03:32:21.900 --> 03:32:24.900]   know, where we've approved that long of a license.
[03:32:24.900 --> 03:32:28.900]   But I think that that is.
[03:32:28.900 --> 03:32:31.900]   I think it's a pretty.
[03:32:31.900 --> 03:32:33.900]   It's a pretty serious act that we should.
[03:32:33.900 --> 03:32:37.900]   Have stronger agreement on.
[03:32:37.900 --> 03:32:41.900]   If we're going to do that and we could decide on the number of
[03:32:41.900 --> 03:32:44.900]   years, if it's four years, if it's five years, if it's 10 years,
[03:32:44.900 --> 03:32:45.900]   whatever it is.
[03:32:45.900 --> 03:32:50.900]   I think it's important that we add that to our list of what would
[03:32:50.900 --> 03:32:52.900]   be, what would require a super majority.
[03:32:52.900 --> 03:32:59.900]   Those were my suggestions on these policies.
[03:32:59.900 --> 03:33:06.900]   So I don't think we need to vote, but we would be direction by
[03:33:06.900 --> 03:33:07.900]   the board if.
[03:33:08.900 --> 03:33:11.900]   We would like staff to revise those.
[03:33:11.900 --> 03:33:15.900]   Board policies to reflect their recommendations made by
[03:33:15.900 --> 03:33:16.900]   trustee Erickson.
[03:33:16.900 --> 03:33:31.900]   And I think for each of these, I think, except for the last one,
[03:33:31.900 --> 03:33:35.900]   I think I have language already that's elsewhere in CSPA that we
[03:33:35.900 --> 03:33:39.900]   can insert there, including the one for board bylaw.
[03:33:39.900 --> 03:33:47.900]   I think I've heard there in regards to questioning by the
[03:33:47.900 --> 03:33:51.900]   board during a board meeting, but then also whether or not the
[03:33:51.900 --> 03:33:56.900]   board president could assign a Disney or approve another board
[03:33:56.900 --> 03:33:58.900]   member to speak to the attorney.
[03:34:01.900 --> 03:34:05.900]   And then for the super majority on the board license lease, I
[03:34:05.900 --> 03:34:07.900]   think that's the appropriate board bylaw.
[03:34:07.900 --> 03:34:11.900]   So just probably connect the legal council on that to
[03:34:11.900 --> 03:34:13.900]   advise on that language.
[03:34:13.900 --> 03:34:21.900]   I have a question and I'm not sure if it's, I couldn't find it
[03:34:21.900 --> 03:34:24.900]   in any of that bylaws here, but I'm not sure.
[03:34:24.900 --> 03:34:30.900]   I know there was recent legislation that requires that board
[03:34:30.900 --> 03:34:34.900]   members have to identify if they receive campaign
[03:34:34.900 --> 03:34:39.900]   contributions above $200 and that they have to recuse
[03:34:39.900 --> 03:34:42.900]   themselves from a vote or something like that.
[03:34:42.900 --> 03:34:47.900]   Or they just have to say it during the vote that, you know,
[03:34:47.900 --> 03:34:53.900]   they have received money from an entity that we are voting on.
[03:34:53.900 --> 03:34:55.900]   And that is law.
[03:34:55.900 --> 03:35:00.900]   So, but is it, and I know we have to follow that, but is that
[03:35:00.900 --> 03:35:03.900]   something that we should be incorporating into our bylaws to
[03:35:03.900 --> 03:35:07.900]   make it consistent so that if somebody wants to go to it and
[03:35:07.900 --> 03:35:09.900]   you can see it right there.
[03:35:09.900 --> 03:35:12.900]   I can review that for you, Trustee Ilmasaki, because I know
[03:35:12.900 --> 03:35:14.900]   that that was a conflict of interest.
[03:35:14.900 --> 03:35:17.900]   Board bylaw was something that we had just revised.
[03:35:17.900 --> 03:35:20.900]   I think we'll be at the last turnaround that we did the last
[03:35:20.900 --> 03:35:21.900]   time.
[03:35:21.900 --> 03:35:25.900]   And it wasn't on the list of CSB bylaws for updates for this
[03:35:25.900 --> 03:35:26.900]   round.
[03:35:26.900 --> 03:35:29.900]   So I'll review the last one to see if that's incorporated.
[03:35:29.900 --> 03:35:32.900]   And it's not, if there's any, because I think there might have
[03:35:32.900 --> 03:35:34.900]   been one update since we put these together.
[03:35:34.900 --> 03:35:36.900]   That's come out from CSB.
[03:35:36.900 --> 03:35:41.900]   >> I think that's an important one to say because, you know.
[03:35:41.900 --> 03:35:42.900]   >> Yeah, certainly.
[03:35:42.900 --> 03:35:45.900]   And then I think we talked about the incorporating that into the
[03:35:45.900 --> 03:35:49.900]   meeting that we have with the candidates for the board.
[03:35:49.900 --> 03:35:50.900]   >> Okay.
[03:35:50.900 --> 03:35:51.900]   Thank you.
[03:35:51.900 --> 03:35:52.900]   >> Any additional?
[03:35:52.900 --> 03:35:53.900]   >> Yeah, I do have one question.
[03:35:53.900 --> 03:35:56.900]   Trustee Erickson made a reference to the student form of the
[03:35:56.900 --> 03:35:57.900]   policy.
[03:35:57.900 --> 03:36:04.900]   I just want to ask her what her intention is with that.
[03:36:04.900 --> 03:36:08.900]   What revisions would you like to see with reforms to the student
[03:36:08.900 --> 03:36:09.900]   form of the policy?
[03:36:09.900 --> 03:36:12.900]   Because I understand that each school side has their own
[03:36:12.900 --> 03:36:14.900]   jurisdiction over the student board members.
[03:36:14.900 --> 03:36:17.900]   And if you'd like to make revisions, I'd be more than happy to
[03:36:17.900 --> 03:36:18.900]   work with you on that.
[03:36:18.900 --> 03:36:19.900]   >> That'd be great.
[03:36:19.900 --> 03:36:21.900]   It's not on the agenda so we can talk offline.
[03:36:21.900 --> 03:36:22.900]   >> Absolutely, of course.
[03:36:22.900 --> 03:36:24.900]   And I do have one question.
[03:36:24.900 --> 03:36:27.900]   It states here that if a charter school governing body requests
[03:36:27.900 --> 03:36:30.900]   technical assistance, the board of education shall provide such
[03:36:30.900 --> 03:36:34.900]   assistance consistent with education code 47607A1 or 2.
[03:36:34.900 --> 03:36:37.900]   If the charter school has not been identified for technical
[03:36:37.900 --> 03:36:41.900]   assistance pursuant to ed code 4607.3a, the board may assess and
[03:36:41.900 --> 03:36:45.900]   fee for the assistance not to exceed the cost of the service.
[03:36:45.900 --> 03:36:48.900]   For charter schools offering technical assistance, the board
[03:36:48.900 --> 03:36:53.900]   may assess and fee for the assistance not to exceed the cost of
[03:36:53.900 --> 03:36:54.900]   the service.
[03:36:54.900 --> 03:36:57.900]   For charter schools operating before July 1, 2020, the technical
[03:36:57.900 --> 03:37:01.900]   assistance provisions of education code 47607.3a, the first
[03:37:01.900 --> 03:37:05.900]   one shall apply to June 3, 2022.
[03:37:05.900 --> 03:37:09.900]   And my question is what defines technical assistance?
[03:37:09.900 --> 03:37:12.900]   Because I'm under the understanding that technical
[03:37:12.900 --> 03:37:16.900]   assistance as far as statutory interpretation goes is that
[03:37:16.900 --> 03:37:25.420]   It relates to repairs, development, and factures, and testing, and maintenance as well. So what's kind of the education definition of a technical system?
[03:37:25.420 --> 03:37:42.720]   Thank you, Mr. Tran. And I did want to confirm that I didn't receive that email from me. It kind of came late in this afternoon. So, uh, we weren't able to get the complete answer back to the board in time. But I did have enough time to alert Ms. Nid that there was a question about that. So, I think we'll turn it over to her.
[03:37:43.440 --> 03:38:05.160]   And I just want to clarify that the charter school oversight pertains to charter schools that we authorized, correct? Yes. The ones that are that are subject to our board policies are the ones that we authorized. So the current, um, charters that we authorized are Santiago and El Rancho.
[03:38:05.160 --> 03:38:17.200]   Um, would it be appropriate for this charter school one to, um, ask that charter schools put their board meetings on a different day than our board meetings?
[03:38:17.200 --> 03:38:29.680]   I don't believe it's a requirement. Um, I know it's not, but it makes it easier for our staff. So they're not splitting their time. And, you know, they're just.
[03:38:29.680 --> 03:38:34.920]   I'll make a note of it and I believe that it's something that we can request of them. Okay.
[03:38:35.920 --> 03:38:41.920]   Thanks. And these are for authorized charter school, obviously. Yeah, right.
[03:38:41.920 --> 03:38:52.920]   Superintendent Gonzalez, the policy that I just referenced, or that certain section, do you have any idea how that may have been implemented? Oh, I'm not, it's my apologies. I've gone home.
[03:38:52.920 --> 03:39:00.920]   No, no apologies necessary. And I don't have the complete answer, but I wanted to have these touched on it and then move to get some information back.
[03:39:00.920 --> 03:39:13.920]   Um, the technical assistance in of itself is a, is a pretty vague definition, but if you mean a lot of different, um, different avenues, um, typically technical assistance is provided, um, really on an individual basis to address identified need.
[03:39:13.920 --> 03:39:21.920]   And that could include things such as, um, relevant resources, programs, and so forth. Um, but we'll get a more complete answer for you.
[03:39:21.920 --> 03:39:32.920]   Of course, absolutely. Thank you so much. It's just, it's interesting because on the last month, our manager Charlie came up here, presenter amazing statistics and their hard work that they're doing here are doing an orange unified.
[03:39:32.920 --> 03:39:45.920]   And I think it'd be awesome to have his policy renewed because the future status quo, if this is removed, charter schools would have to go through the county board of education, which is a whole different process as a whole different jurisdiction.
[03:39:45.920 --> 03:39:48.920]   Right. So that's something to take into consideration.
[03:39:49.920 --> 03:40:03.920]   Thank you. We will get you a complete answer, but some of the technical assistance that a charter school might need, like, uh, just the same as some of our schools that get technical assistance also get that from the county as well.
[03:40:03.920 --> 03:40:05.920]   Of course, thank you.
[03:40:08.920 --> 03:40:25.920]   Thank you. And thank you for also bringing up those two board members policy. That was something that superintendent Gonzalez and I were planning to bring up this coming year as well and work with our board members to revise it and enhance it because it does need additional certification.
[03:40:25.920 --> 03:40:27.920]   Right. It's very old.
[03:40:27.920 --> 03:40:37.920]   Yeah, I think it just, it doesn't incorporate any of the code of conduct that you all have spoken about. Like, there's just a lot of things that it's just old. It just needs to be updated.
[03:40:37.920 --> 03:40:47.920]   Well, and also some of the things in that, um, in that board bylaw, we thought might be because it seems like each year are our student board members take on a project.
[03:40:47.920 --> 03:41:03.920]   And so we were talking about the different types of projects that we could present to them. And, um, and so there was some pieces in that work by law that we wanted to present to the student board members as a suggested projects for them for this year.
[03:41:03.920 --> 03:41:19.920]   Absolutely. I'm interested in you spoke of, you know, kind of court of conduct, court of politics, court of conduct. And as far as board policy goes, I do believe that student board members are on an equal standing with their fellow trustees at board meetings as recognized, right?
[03:41:19.920 --> 03:41:27.920]   But to add on to that, I believe you also do CSB trainings as well, which should be expected for student board members.
[03:41:27.920 --> 03:41:37.920]   Yes, and I believe Miss Eric shared that all of you are registered. So it's exciting that our incoming student board members are already planning ahead.
[03:41:37.920 --> 03:41:39.920]   Going back to.
[03:41:39.920 --> 03:41:49.920]   Yeah, the comment. Well, I just comment that could we get a copy of your answers to Mr. Frans questions to.
[03:41:49.920 --> 03:41:53.920]   Yes, the ones for the charter school will be sent to all the board members.
[03:41:53.920 --> 03:42:07.920]   Thank you. In the beginning, Tracy Erickson also asked and requested a revision or a review of all our board policies and bylaws. And I just wanted to ask the board.
[03:42:07.920 --> 03:42:20.920]   Is that something that you would want to review as its own study session or be included a part of the training and creation.
[03:42:20.920 --> 03:42:30.920]   Just so you know what I was thinking, I was thinking that we would initially do, we would chunk it out. Like, in other words, we've always go over these policies like twice a year. There's no reason we need to do that.
[03:42:30.920 --> 03:42:41.920]   Like, we could start with for bylaws and sort of look at those and decide if we want to make any changes and then kind of move on from there.
[03:42:41.920 --> 03:42:49.920]   Knowing that staff is going to bring us legal changes. So these are just changes that we as a board might want to establish as a policy.
[03:42:49.920 --> 03:42:56.920]   So the superintendent could ask all the board members if there's any additional policies, they would also like to bring up for review.
[03:42:56.920 --> 03:42:59.920]   Right. Thank you.
[03:42:59.920 --> 03:43:03.920]   Any additional comments?
[03:43:03.920 --> 03:43:04.920]   Okay.
[03:43:04.920 --> 03:43:08.920]   Thank you for the discussion.
[03:43:08.920 --> 03:43:17.920]   Now moving on to consent items, consent items can be taken all as one, unless there's an item to be pulled.
[03:43:17.920 --> 03:43:21.920]   If not, is there a motion to approve items?
[03:43:21.920 --> 03:43:25.920]   Thank you, Trustee LaTega. Is there a second?
[03:43:25.920 --> 03:43:30.920]   Thank you, Trustee Glass. Any discussion or questions?
[03:43:30.920 --> 03:43:32.920]   All in favor?
[03:43:32.920 --> 03:43:36.920]   Motion passes 7-0.
[03:43:36.920 --> 03:43:39.920]   17 public comment on non-agentized items.
[03:43:39.920 --> 03:43:46.920]   Trustee Erickson. Yes, we have several, three of which are the USD students who will be going first.
[03:43:46.920 --> 03:43:51.920]   Do you want me to read the public comment language again?
[03:43:51.920 --> 03:44:04.920]   All right. First up, Alexander Tran.
[03:44:04.920 --> 03:44:10.920]   Perfect. Well, thank you. You guys knew who I am. My name is Alex Tran. I'm a student board member at Boulevard High School.
[03:44:10.920 --> 03:44:21.920]   I am a senior and about to graduate. Looking at the previous discussion that we had at the board meeting and Trustee's Erickson's request to update the meeting costs.
[03:44:21.920 --> 03:44:25.920]   I believe it also, I'm not going to be in cause of my apologies, there are costs for the 50-meter pool.
[03:44:25.920 --> 03:44:33.920]   I believe it also be wise as a matter of transparency to include how much money that we have for current reserves for restricted facilities funding.
[03:44:33.920 --> 03:44:42.920]   I checked out Niagara Niagara's 2023 financial audit and we have $100 million in restricted funding for buildings facilities only.
[03:44:42.920 --> 03:44:52.920]   And to add on to that, we have a $24 million, which is replenished annually in county school facilities fund, which is supposed to be used for modernization projects like a 50-meter pool.
[03:44:52.920 --> 03:45:00.920]   So just as a matter of transparency, I believe it would be wise to add that as well. Thank you so much.
[03:45:00.920 --> 03:45:10.920]   Next up, Aiden Kilborn, followed by Lucy Flynn.
[03:45:10.920 --> 03:45:17.920]   Good evening board members. My name is Aiden Kilborn and I'm here to speak on the 50-meter pool for Boulevard High School.
[03:45:17.920 --> 03:45:23.920]   So currently I'm going to my fourth year of high school and aquatics at Boulevard High School.
[03:45:23.920 --> 03:45:30.920]   And this program has done a lot for me. I came into the school not being athletic at all and never having done sports before and honestly it wasn't very social.
[03:45:30.920 --> 03:45:39.920]   And coming into this program, I was able to do something physically and grow my social life largely as I think many other students are able to do.
[03:45:39.920 --> 03:45:53.920]   So this should be the focus and a strong point of our aquatics program in our pool, but due to the current state of the pool, instead of having these positive effects on people's physical health and social activities with students around them,
[03:45:53.920 --> 03:46:10.920]   it's grown to be negatively impacting some students with many students I know personally getting injured such as cutting themselves on the pool deck due to its deteriorated state from low repairs over a long period of time.
[03:46:10.920 --> 03:46:24.920]   So I think that repairing the school would be able to solve this problem and I think it's a necessity to preserve the safety of the students.
[03:46:24.920 --> 03:46:40.920]   And in addition to the safety and preservation of the desire of the students to exercise, it also has the opportunity to expand on these great things that it already offers because with a larger pool area with a 50 meter pool,
[03:46:40.920 --> 03:46:56.920]   there's more space for more activities, more students' growth of current programs to participate simultaneously and we can host larger events and with these larger events it even further promotes our school,
[03:46:56.920 --> 03:47:13.920]   people to come to our school and we can host larger events which can draw in, again, other students with people wanting to come and see the events or it can generate revenue such as any other large sporting event to do throughout the district.
[03:47:13.920 --> 03:47:23.920]   And I just think there's a lot of good qualities that can be preserved by repairing and renewing our pool.
[03:47:23.920 --> 03:47:29.920]   That's all I have to say. Thank you for your time.
[03:47:29.920 --> 03:47:40.920]   Thank you. Lucy Flynn.
[03:47:40.920 --> 03:47:48.920]   Good evening, board members. I'm also here to talk about the 50 meter pool at Belle Park High School.
[03:47:48.920 --> 03:47:57.920]   Our pool is honestly becoming a liability for anyone who sets even foot on deck, not just hops in the water.
[03:47:57.920 --> 03:48:06.920]   This past summer we actually had a girl had to get 11 stitches after she cut her foot open on pool wall.
[03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:25.920]   At the last minute we had a boy from another team cut open his foot while also getting out of the pool. I think it's just a matter of time before the pool becomes too much of a liability and someone gets very seriously injured and then the district could possibly get sued.
[03:48:25.920 --> 03:48:42.920]   And then I think a 50 meter pool is the best decision for our district since every single surrounding district has at least 150 meter pool, most of them more, just like the Irvine district, which every single high school has a 50 meter pool.
[03:48:42.920 --> 03:49:01.920]   And this year we will also be combining leagues with the freeway league and all of their schools have received new pools, five out of the six schools in that district have received a new pool and their sixth one is going to be starting soon.
[03:49:01.920 --> 03:49:22.920]   Also, a 50 meter pool would give our coaches more etiquette space to run practices because right now for water polo, both varsity and junior varsity have to practice together, which honestly our coaches should be giving the junior varsity kids more like different treatment than the varsity kids.
[03:49:22.920 --> 03:49:31.920]   So they can work up their skills and become better water polo players so that we can have a more elite team.
[03:49:31.920 --> 03:49:40.920]   And then during swim season, our coaches have to run two separate practices during the day because there are too many kids for our pool to accommodate.
[03:49:40.920 --> 03:50:00.920]   So we have a morning session and an evening session for our aquatics athletes and a 50 meter pool would allow our coaches to run one practice and it would also give our coaches better opportunity to help our athletes enhance their skills and their abilities and make our team more elite.
[03:50:00.920 --> 03:50:19.920]   So that's all I have to say. Thank you. Thank you, Lucy. Next up is Alex Broussot.
[03:50:19.920 --> 03:50:30.920]   My name is Alex Broussot. I am a parent of a wonderful child in Orange Unified School District. I'm a homeowner. I'm a taxpayer in the district.
[03:50:30.920 --> 03:50:40.920]   I'm here for three minutes tonight to celebrate, not because I turned 42 today, but I'm here to celebrate Orange Unified School District.
[03:50:40.920 --> 03:50:53.920]   I'm here to celebrate Orange Unified School District because when I got involved in Orange Unified School District, there was a board majority of Rick Ladesma, Madison Minor, John Ortega, and Angie Rumsey.
[03:50:53.920 --> 03:51:09.920]   And I'm celebrating tonight because as of this December, Rick Ladesma, Madison Minor, Angie Rumsey, and John Ortega will no longer be trustees in Orange Unified School District.
[03:51:09.920 --> 03:51:21.920]   We said no more. We got up and we said no, you can't do these things. We recalled two of them. The other two decided that the public said no and decided not to run for reelection.
[03:51:21.920 --> 03:51:35.920]   As I look back at the last 20 months, I'm thankful and I'm celebrating our community. I'm celebrating the friends I made along the way. I'm celebrating the leaders of the recall.
[03:51:35.920 --> 03:51:53.920]   And I'm celebrating the wonderful staff in Orange Unified School District that weathered the storm, that stayed with us, that stayed in our school district, that didn't go elsewhere when they were tempted to do so, that didn't flee the school district like so many did.
[03:51:53.920 --> 03:52:06.920]   The wonderful administrators, the wonderful teachers, and the wonderful people who are bringing in the next school year, who are helping our children to learn and grow.
[03:52:06.920 --> 03:52:21.920]   And I look forward to the future and the future that we have with the candidates who are running for the vacant seats that are being left by John Ortega and Angie Rumsey in Matthew Thomas and Sierra Vane.
[03:52:21.920 --> 03:52:30.920]   And the reelections of Trustees Anna Page, Stephen Glass, and Sarah Pelley.
[03:52:30.920 --> 03:52:50.920]   I look forward to the good work that will be done in Orange Unified School District by a school board that I hope will be transparent, that I hope will govern on behalf of the students in Orange Unified School District for the benefit of the students in Orange Unified School District.
[03:52:50.920 --> 03:52:56.920]   Thank you very much.
[03:52:56.920 --> 03:53:08.920]   Thank you. Next up we have Greg Goodlander.
[03:53:08.920 --> 03:53:21.920]   Good evening, Board President Page, members of the board, Superintendent Gonzalez, Cabinet, and community. I am Greg Goodlander, the proud president of the Orange Unified Education Association, OUEA.
[03:53:21.920 --> 03:53:24.920]   I'm here tonight to talk about two things.
[03:53:24.920 --> 03:53:37.920]   The first is the next school year. In my five years as union president, I've gone through the COVID-19 pandemic, I've gone through the political strife and chaos of this last school year, and I've led our union through some tough contract negotiations.
[03:53:37.920 --> 03:53:58.920]   And through the past five years, much has changed. From new superintendents, to regional trustees, to new trustees, through constantly changing cabinets, to the excitement of measure S facility enhancements, but what hasn't changed is that OUEA is still here, I'm still here, and I believe that OUEA is stronger now than ever before.
[03:53:58.920 --> 03:54:04.920]   I'm hopeful for more calm in this space in this room, and I'm looking forward to what lies ahead.
[03:54:04.920 --> 03:54:13.920]   OUEA will continue to work for better public education, and with that, I'll be to my second topic, community schools.
[03:54:13.920 --> 03:54:24.920]   A few months ago, Trustee Erickson from the Dias specifically asked for a presentation regarding community schools grants and program that's currently in place in OUSD.
[03:54:24.920 --> 03:54:34.920]   Such a public presentation can highlight what is going well, share areas of growth, and provide you as trustees the opportunity to oversee this program.
[03:54:34.920 --> 03:54:47.920]   The community schools grant program provides additional funding to about one fourth of our schools, and theoretically, parents, staff, and students provide input on allocation of these new resources at a school.
[03:54:47.920 --> 03:54:55.920]   OUEA supports this program, but does have concerns about its current implementation. We are not alone.
[03:54:55.920 --> 03:55:04.920]   Public comment in this room has been for improvement of the community schools initiative, and the trustee has asked for this presentation.
[03:55:04.920 --> 03:55:18.920]   The public, the board, and the union request that you please direct your staff leadership to provide a public presentation and have a conversation about the community schools program currently in place in OUSD.
[03:55:18.920 --> 03:55:24.920]   And with that, otherwise, I do want to say that I am looking forward to a great exciting year, some calm.
[03:55:24.920 --> 03:55:30.920]   OUEA is here to support our students and our community and advocate for great public education. Thank you.
[03:55:30.920 --> 03:55:35.920]   Thank you.
[03:55:35.920 --> 03:55:41.920]   Next up, Kara Sparks.
[03:55:41.920 --> 03:55:48.920]   And then Tatiana.
[03:55:48.920 --> 03:56:02.920]   I know I'm a taxpayer homeowner and a mom of two second generation OUSD students, one of which we just heard from. And when you heard from a couple of sessions ago, talking about eSports, she's at USC now.
[03:56:02.920 --> 03:56:06.920]   So I want to talk to you about the poll.
[03:56:06.920 --> 03:56:15.920]   Why a new poll? Well, obviously you heard from Lucy the age and the quality of the poll is just not good. It's not good at all. It's bad.
[03:56:15.920 --> 03:56:25.920]   There's multiple injuries, including stitches. And obviously the water is a big concern as our students are breathing in this water and it is disgusting.
[03:56:25.920 --> 03:56:36.920]   So we have to think about illness and other types of injuries that they're cutting themselves and there's dirty water that's causing problems with bacteria, potential infection.
[03:56:36.920 --> 03:56:50.920]   And, excuse me, losses as she mentioned. So repeated repairs and closures resulting in gains and needs disruptions as well as issues with the water quality, which I mentioned.
[03:56:50.920 --> 03:56:53.920]   Now, why a 50 meter?
[03:56:53.920 --> 03:56:58.920]   Well, again, we can accommodate a large swim program.
[03:56:58.920 --> 03:57:08.920]   Most of the districts in Orange County have at least 150 meter pool within the district. We do not. We are not competitive.
[03:57:08.920 --> 03:57:16.920]   And this can also help our students have access to proper training and most of the off season swimming is in 50 meter pools.
[03:57:16.920 --> 03:57:25.920]   These are used in professional and club events so we can use it for renting out for monetary value to the district.
[03:57:25.920 --> 03:57:34.920]   As we see enrollment decline as we just saw in the presentation, we need to be thinking about revenue generation and this is one way we can do that.
[03:57:34.920 --> 03:57:42.920]   And then I keep hearing the concerns about the cost, but I'm not hearing anyone speak of the value, nor have I heard discussions around an ROI.
[03:57:42.920 --> 03:57:49.920]   If there wasn't, I would love to see it because we need to be speaking about that as well, not just the cost.
[03:57:49.920 --> 03:57:57.920]   Though I agree we should be ensuring the money is spent is not spent excessively. This pool can be a substantial revenue stream.
[03:57:57.920 --> 03:58:03.920]   Allowing for me to our district currently has no opportunity to host with our smaller pools.
[03:58:03.920 --> 03:58:08.920]   The revenue is going to surrounding districts that do in fact have 50 meter pools.
[03:58:08.920 --> 03:58:18.920]   So IDP, the number of students in our program, the CIF rankings within our school. We have a CIF champion that just spoke to you today.
[03:58:18.920 --> 03:58:26.920]   We have the third rated GPA and in the CF list. We have the coach of the year.
[03:58:26.920 --> 03:58:34.920]   We have two students that were mentioned in the top county again when sitting here and it can be accessible by all pools.
[03:58:34.920 --> 03:58:38.920]   All students that need a pool like Fred Kelly.
[03:58:38.920 --> 03:58:44.920]   That's it. Thank you.
[03:58:44.920 --> 03:58:50.920]   Thank you. And I'm having a hard time reading this name, but I think it's Tatiana.
[03:58:50.920 --> 03:58:55.920]   Thank you.
[03:58:55.920 --> 03:59:07.920]   Hello. Good evening, everyone. My name is Tatiana Andresky. I have been on goals for four years. I'd like to start with how on our end to be here representing the team that showed me the best
[03:59:07.920 --> 03:59:16.920]   partnership and how to go as a person. I think that what many of you don't take into perspective is that it's not just a team. It's not just swing for fun.
[03:59:16.920 --> 03:59:19.920]   Throughout the years we've been made, we've made a lot of accomplishments.
[03:59:19.920 --> 03:59:27.920]   The ones that made all of our coaches so proud, the CIF plaque right at the beginning of the pool entrance.
[03:59:27.920 --> 03:59:39.920]   This entire team is a family we've been traveling with two different summits, a family that we'll be with for years to come, and a family of bright individuals who dedicate a lot of their time to swimming.
[03:59:39.920 --> 03:59:44.920]   I can't start to explain all the happiness this team has brought me, but I will say this.
[03:59:44.920 --> 03:59:54.920]   Every single morning practice, every afternoon practice, and every move schedule or swimming that I've been with on this team has shown me how important it is to be on a team.
[03:59:54.920 --> 04:00:01.920]   Even more to be on a team that others can rely on that won't have a pool that breaks down every other week.
[04:00:01.920 --> 04:00:10.920]   We have asked so many times for other teams' help and they're out of the kindness of their heart and out of the generosity. They have allowed us to use their pool.
[04:00:10.920 --> 04:00:15.920]   When does it our turn to repay all those other teams that have allowed us to use their pool?
[04:00:15.920 --> 04:00:21.920]   If we had a 50-meter pool, not only could we host more meets, we could hold more practices for our own team.
[04:00:21.920 --> 04:00:32.920]   There has been many times that our practices have overlapped, leaving us with limited amount of lanes because our 25-meter pool is not sufficient and is not well maintained.
[04:00:32.920 --> 04:00:42.920]   Not to mention the amount of meat warm-up so we couldn't do all of the practices that we needed because of the fact that it wasn't an offer room.
[04:00:42.920 --> 04:00:51.920]   As a swimmer myself, I can't begin to express the frustration it brings me and all the other swimmers when we are denied access to a new pool to be built.
[04:00:51.920 --> 04:00:59.920]   Everything else on campus is up to speed. For a few weeks now, construction workers have been working on the gym, for example, that is across from the pool.
[04:00:59.920 --> 04:01:10.920]   The swim pool field track and the baseball field are all up to the Olympic standard. I can't believe it takes these many people telling you how helpful a 50-meter pool would be to understand the importance of this decision.
[04:01:10.920 --> 04:01:12.920]   Thank you for your time.
[04:01:12.920 --> 04:01:32.920]   Thank you. Jerry Oczewski.
[04:01:32.920 --> 04:01:42.920]   My name is Jerry Oczewski. I'm the head coach of Orange County Gold. I'm also a volunteer coach for Villapart High School.
[04:01:42.920 --> 04:01:57.920]   I've been coaching for over 40 years. I've seen a lot of pools. I've seen a lot of facilities, good and bad. I've also coached high school teams, college teams.
[04:01:57.920 --> 04:02:15.920]   Orange County Gold is a 501(c)(3) youth oriented sports team. We operate primarily out of Villapart High School. Sometimes we use Orange High School when it's allowed.
[04:02:15.920 --> 04:02:33.920]   All three members of our present team live within the OUSD boundaries. This is truly an OUSD-sponsored youth sports program.
[04:02:33.920 --> 04:02:44.920]   This year, every member of the summer team, the summer water polo program, all of our swim lessons, and our master's group live within the boundaries.
[04:02:44.920 --> 04:02:59.920]   Currently, our OUSD community-based program can only offer the summer team, water polo team lessons, and master's swimming in the summer because of the restrictions.
[04:02:59.920 --> 04:03:13.920]   Just in time, kids are in school, it gets dark early, it gets cold, there's no locker rooms. The kids have to walk or know about 100-150 yards to the bathroom.
[04:03:13.920 --> 04:03:20.920]   It's not a good situation. The pool is in disrepair.
[04:03:20.920 --> 04:03:37.920]   I've seen when they fix the pool or when they repair it, I've seen some of the plumbing. Even if they re-plaster the pool, the amount of time and effort and money to re-plumb the entire facility,
[04:03:37.920 --> 04:03:57.920]   you might as well just build a whole new 50-meter pool. The 50-meter pool is considered a multi-use facility, a 25-yard pool, which all the OUSD pools are right now, are single-use,
[04:03:57.920 --> 04:04:10.920]   meaning only your water polo program can use the pool at one time or the swim program, and we have to take all the lane lines out, the water polo, the water polo has to put in their goals.
[04:04:10.920 --> 04:04:21.920]   There's a lot of wasted time. This is OUSD's second attempt to build a 50-meter multi-use facility. The first was ELMO.
[04:04:21.920 --> 04:04:36.920]   Now they have a single-use facility. It's a 30-meter pool that only one sport can be in at a time or, as mentioned before, only the varsity team or the JVT.
[04:04:36.920 --> 04:04:49.920]   Thank you.
[04:04:49.920 --> 04:04:55.920]   Moving on to other business, board or staff, conference or comments.
[04:04:55.920 --> 04:05:04.920]   I just want to renew my request again for a presentation on community schools, which I believe is in the works. I'm hoping.
[04:05:04.920 --> 04:05:26.920]   I'm wondering if we can, as part of the pool conversation, in bringing back different information, maybe give us some information on how much revenue a pool can generate, both 50-meter and whatever other size pools you're bringing back to.
[04:05:26.920 --> 04:05:33.920]   I don't know if there's any difference in how much they can generate, but I think it might be worth us looking at.
[04:05:33.920 --> 04:05:40.920]   Thank you.
[04:05:40.920 --> 04:06:02.920]   I think the board received last Friday a draft calendar of the board of education meetings for the entire year, and if you look in the education services section, you'll see that you have well spaces for September and then community schools and for October.
[04:06:02.920 --> 04:06:06.920]   Thank you.
[04:06:06.920 --> 04:06:22.920]   Just as a follow-up as well, and there were some very poignant questions that were brought up as well associated with the pool, and unfortunately I wasn't able to be here, but I would ask the board to have a vision.
[04:06:22.920 --> 04:06:41.920]   And the vision is we want to see that we're updating all of our schools, modernizations, you know, second phases, where have you, all of our kids are going to matriculate to and from and through the high school.
[04:06:41.920 --> 04:06:59.920]   And so we want the attractability in that nature, and this could be another form of that, so that the, it was spoken about the ROI, you know, with the return on investment, and it'd be a huge investment.
[04:06:59.920 --> 04:07:09.920]   If you looked at what just took place recently with the Olympics, that right there is going to be here in four years.
[04:07:09.920 --> 04:07:13.920]   Guess what they're going to need in four years?
[04:07:13.920 --> 04:07:17.920]   Accessibility to 50-meter pools.
[04:07:17.920 --> 04:07:28.920]   If you looked at the time trial here in Indianapolis, where the Indianapolis Colts play, they put up an aquatic center in a week.
[04:07:28.920 --> 04:07:42.920]   With the Olympics, they had a Taylor Swift concert two days prior, and in 48 hours they put up two Mertha pools in that center.
[04:07:42.920 --> 04:07:45.920]   This is the Olympics.
[04:07:45.920 --> 04:07:57.920]   So I asked this board to have that type of vision that if the Olympics can do this in two days, literally, why can't we do that?
[04:07:57.920 --> 04:08:16.920]   So the other thing is that when our own staff came to us, an initial $30 million project, and it was reduced down to a realistic number.
[04:08:16.920 --> 04:08:18.920]   I hope we're kind of like out of line right now.
[04:08:18.920 --> 04:08:22.920]   We're talking about an agenda item, and an item that's not on the agenda.
[04:08:22.920 --> 04:08:26.920]   No, this is open comments.
[04:08:26.920 --> 04:08:30.920]   You were talking about an item that's not on the agenda.
[04:08:30.920 --> 04:08:37.920]   Usually open comments are reserved for like, "Oh, literally, what are we going to do in the future at the next meeting?"
[04:08:37.920 --> 04:08:39.920]   If you'd like to request it to be on the next meeting.
[04:08:39.920 --> 04:08:41.920]   Sure, then I would request it to be on the next meeting.
[04:08:41.920 --> 04:08:45.920]   Okay, but I think it's unfair for you to talk about it, and we can't respond appropriately.
[04:08:45.920 --> 04:08:47.920]   And it was on the agenda last month.
[04:08:47.920 --> 04:08:48.920]   Yeah.
[04:08:48.920 --> 04:08:51.920]   And I did mention that.
[04:08:51.920 --> 04:08:56.920]   So anyway, yeah, so I'd request it to be on the agenda next month.
[04:08:56.920 --> 04:08:57.920]   Okay.
[04:08:57.920 --> 04:08:59.920]   I have a lot of questions.
[04:08:59.920 --> 04:09:11.920]   I'd also like to make a request as well, and for the next meeting, I understand that the school site, prior to the July 18th meeting, made massive concessions to bring down the cost of the pool down to the proper budget.
[04:09:11.920 --> 04:09:13.920]   Those were never presented at the July 18th meeting.
[04:09:13.920 --> 04:09:25.920]   If you can have those numbers, you know, also requested and also displayed at the next month's meeting, I believe that would be -- or at least when the pool's on the agenda, that would be proper.
[04:09:25.920 --> 04:09:26.920]   Thank you.
[04:09:26.920 --> 04:09:32.920]   You know, you're really asking our staff to read your meeting that we just did last month because you missed it.
[04:09:32.920 --> 04:09:33.920]   I think that --
[04:09:33.920 --> 04:09:34.920]   No, I'm not.
[04:09:34.920 --> 04:09:35.920]   Actually --
[04:09:35.920 --> 04:09:36.920]   No, it's not.
[04:09:36.920 --> 04:09:39.920]   They're actually updating the comments.
[04:09:39.920 --> 04:09:42.920]   They are, honey, that update us later on in the year.
[04:09:42.920 --> 04:09:46.920]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[04:09:46.920 --> 04:09:54.920]   Well, I would only ask them to come back with an agenda -- with an item if they have an update, like with new information.
[04:09:54.920 --> 04:09:58.920]   The staff is working on some of the items that they are --
[04:09:58.920 --> 04:10:01.920]   I mean, they're putting together -- they're starting school.
[04:10:01.920 --> 04:10:04.920]   They can't be just focused on one item at this moment.
[04:10:04.920 --> 04:10:06.920]   They did it last month, and you weren't here.
[04:10:06.920 --> 04:10:09.920]   I'm sorry you missed it.
[04:10:09.920 --> 04:10:10.920]   Okay.
[04:10:10.920 --> 04:10:11.920]   If you're against the pool, then just say --
[04:10:11.920 --> 04:10:13.920]   I didn't say I was against the pool.
[04:10:13.920 --> 04:10:16.920]   If you listened to the meeting, I said I wanted to fill all of our options.
[04:10:16.920 --> 04:10:18.920]   It's our duty to do that.
[04:10:18.920 --> 04:10:20.920]   Okay, and I'm just asking the board to have a vision to --
[04:10:20.920 --> 04:10:22.920]   But you weren't here last month at all.
[04:10:22.920 --> 04:10:23.920]   It doesn't matter.
[04:10:23.920 --> 04:10:25.920]   We're talking about today.
[04:10:25.920 --> 04:10:34.920]   So, just to close this out, staff is preparing to follow up on the last meeting that we had.
[04:10:34.920 --> 04:10:40.920]   We're preparing things, and we'll take the comments that were made right now into consideration in that presentation.
[04:10:40.920 --> 04:10:41.920]   Thank you.
[04:10:41.920 --> 04:10:49.920]   While you're at it, can you also add the information that we talked about a year ago regarding the canyon pool and the orange pool,
[04:10:49.920 --> 04:10:52.920]   and that's the status of their pools as well?
[04:10:52.920 --> 04:10:56.920]   I believe that that was part of the request the last time, and it's planned to bring that information back.
[04:10:56.920 --> 04:10:58.920]   Okay, thank you.
[04:10:58.920 --> 04:10:59.920]   Thank you.
[04:10:59.920 --> 04:11:01.920]   Board meetings adjourned in 906.
[04:11:01.920 --> 04:11:02.920]   Thank you.
[04:11:40.920 --> 04:11:42.980]   you
