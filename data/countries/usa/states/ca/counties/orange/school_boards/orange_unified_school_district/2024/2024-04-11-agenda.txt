DESCRIPTION: In August 2022, the District received a pledge of $500,000 through a charitable pledge agreement with Freddie
and Chelsea Freeman. Mr. Freeman is the current Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman and former El Modena High School
scholar and student athlete. The donation, which was the largest donation in District history from a single private donor, was to
be used toward the construction of a 1,440 square foot boys' baseball clubhouse to include a locker room, a team meeting area
with monitors and a coaches' office, and larger batting cages. In recognition of the generous donation, the District would like to
name the facility in Mr. Freeman's honor.
Board Policy 7310 lists a specific protocol for the naming of schools, but indicates that [a]t the discretion of the Board, buildings,
rooms, property, playing fields and equipment of the Orange Unified School District may be assigned names that designate
certain geographical locations or areas, commemorate historical events, or those which have special significance for the
community, or commemorate an individual or groups of individuals who have made civic, educational, or cultural contributions or
who have brought special recognition to the school system through service, prominence or heroism.
To honor and thank Mr. Freeman, District staff recommend that the Board of Education name the El Modena High School
Baseball Facility "The Freddie Freeman Clubhouse".

Education Code and Board Bylaw.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: The Orange County Registrar of Voters (ROV) certified the March 5, 2024 election results on March 22, 2024.
The certified results created two Trustee vacancies for Orange Unified School District. School Boards under Education Code
section 5091 have three options available that must be taken within 60 calendar days from the ROV certification:

1. Appoint new Board members by May 21, 2024, who will serve until the next school board election in November 2024,
when a Special Election will be held to fill the remaining two years of the Trustees term. This is known as a provisional
appointment because a petition can be filed with the County Superintendent of Schools to require an election to fill the
vacancy.
2. Leave the offices vacant and the Board can instead call for a Special Election to take place on November 5, 2024.
3. The Board can take no action within the 60 days. If no action is taken by the Board, then the County Superintendent is
required to call a Special Election which would take place on November 5, 2024
Board Member Eligibility
Board Bylaw 9220(a) sets forth the qualifications for eligibility:
Any person is eligible to be a Board member, without further qualifications, if he/she is 18 years of age or older, a citizen of
California, a resident of the school District a registered voter and not legally disqualified from holding civil office. Any person who
has been convicted of a felony involving the giving, accepting, or offering of a bribe, embezzlement or theft of public funds,
extortion, perjury, or conspiracy to commit any such crime, under California law or the law of another state, the United States of
America, or another country, is not eligible to be a candidate for office or be a Board member except when the person has been
granted a pardon in accordance with law. (Education Code 35107; Elections Code 20)
A District employee elected (or appointed) to the Board shall resign his/her position before being sworn in or shall have his/her
employment automatically terminated upon being sworn into office. (E.C. 35107) Provisional Appointment
Provisional Appointments
Board Bylaw 9223 summarizes this process and provides the following guidance. Part of this guidance is not provided for in the
Education Code.

1. The Board Bylaw provides the Board shall advertise in the local media to solicit candidate applications or nominations.
2. A committee consisting of less than the quorum of the Board shall ensure applicants are eligible for Board membership
and announce the names of the eligible candidates.

3. Set a date for the Board to interview all eligible candidates at a public meeting, accept oral or written public input to
select the provisional appointees by majority vote.

4. Per Education Code section 5092, within 10 calendar days after the appointments, the Board shall post notice of the
actual vacancy and the names of the provisional appointments. The notice shall be published in the local newspaper
and posted in at least three public places within the District. The notice shall contain:
i. The date of the vacancy and the effective date of the resignation.

ii. The full name of the appointee.
iii. The date of the appointment
iv. A statement notifying the voters that unless a petition calling for a special election pursuant to Education Code
5091 is filled in the office of the County Superintendent of Schools within 30 days of the provisional
appointment, it shall become an effective appointment.

5. The persons provisionally appointed shall hold office until the next regularly scheduled election for District Board
members and shall hold all the powers and duties of a Board member upon appointment.

6. A provisional appointment by the Board may be challenged by a petition (submitted within 30 days of the provisional
appointment) signed by at least 1 ½ percent of the number of registered voters of the district at the time of the last
regular election for governing board members.

7. The County Superintendent shall have 30 days to verify the signatures. If the petition is determined to be legally
sufficient by the County Superintendent, then the provisional appointment shall be terminated, and the County
Superintendent of Schools shall order the special election to be conducted.
Should the Board choose to make provisional appointments the following steps are recommended:
Staff will advertise on the District website and in local media announcing the vacancy and soliciting candidate
applications.
Applications will be open April 12, 2024 and close on April 26, 2024. Applications are to be submitted to the
Superintendent's Office by 4:00pm on the closing date. Applications received after the closing will not be considered.
The eligible candidates' name(s) will be announced to the Board and posted on the District website.
Interviews with the Board of Education will be scheduled for May 2, 2024. Additional dates may be considered
depending on the number of eligible candidates to ensure that the provisional appointments may be made within 60
calendar days.
Applications for the eligible candidates will be provided to the Board of Education for review prior to interviews.
Voting - Seven Member Board with Two Vacancies
Education Code section 35165 modifies the voting requirements when there are vacancies on a seven-member board as follows,
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a school district governing board consists of seven members and not more than
two vacancies occur on the governing board, the vacant position or positions shall not be counted for purposes of determining
how many members of the board constitute a majority.
FISCAL IMPACT: Cost of the election will be determined by the Registrar of Voters.
