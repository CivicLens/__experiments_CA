Action: A. LICENSE AGREEMENT BY AND AMONG ORANGE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, EXPLORE ACADEMY
CHARTER SCHOOL, AND EXPLOREK12
Gloria Romero; Dr. Charles Heaton; Kelly Felton: Asked for approval from the board of the lease license agreement with
Explore Academy Academy School.
Soren Williams, OUSD parent: There was no support for the academy from the OCDE but the board majority approved it
anyway. They want to tear down public education with questionable charters.
Mike Tardif: The school will be serving Spanish-speaking families.
Rosa Otero: The school has one public grant from California. There is no outside money.
Michelle Loveland: School choice matters. We should have healthy competition. Public education matters and comes in
different forms.
Legal Counsel Ms. Harden presented the item. During the discussion by the board, Trustee Erickson clarified that this is not a
Charter School approval, just a license agreement for use and payment of facilities. The agreement is not a Prop 39
agreement and Explore Academy waived their Prop 39 for 2024-2025. There are no other Explore Academy sites operating in
Orange County. Explore Academy will be paying $74,476.82 for the 2023-2024 school year ($6,770 per month). This will
increase to $84,514 for the 2024-2025 school year ($7,000 per month). There are no educational services involved in the
agreement. The agreement is based on space, regardless of the number of students. The agreement can be terminated with
or without cause at any time. Olive Crest paid roughly $16,000 per month which included additional portable classrooms,
some owned by the district, and some by Olive Crest. President Ledesma clarified that the footprint of the land is the same,
but Olive Crest had additional facilities that Explore Academy will not have. Legal Counsel Ms. Harden clarified that the square
footage rate that the district charges is for building space and not land space.
Call for the question to end all discussion.

Procedural: A. Non-Agenda Items: Members of the audience may address the Board of Education on non-agenda items that
are within the Board’s subject matter jurisdiction. Speaking time is limited to three (3) minutes per speaker with a maximum
of twenty (20) minutes per topic. Persons wishing to speak should submit a Public Comment card prior to the meeting. Non-

agenda items may neither be acted upon nor discussed by the Board, but will be responded to either by telephone, mail, or at
a subsequent meeting.
Lorrie Kaylor: Citizens have been lied to by members of the recall effort.
Jennie Sloan, OUSD parent: If the Board president cares about the students in West Orange, he should invest in their public education
and not sell out.
Erinne Mejia: Some speakers had insider information on closed session items. Lack of transparency.
Karin Barone, OUSD parent: Even though parents have expressed it as a priority, this board will never lower class sizes. All the money
that has been wasted since the January 5th meeting could have been used for our students.
Maria L: Thanked board members Ledesma, Ortega, and Miner for protecting parents' rights.
Joette: Thanked board members Ledesma, Ortega, Rumsey, and Miner for all they do. It's the kids that matter.
Tanya: Read from Red Hood by Elena Arnold. What value does this book hold?
Michelle Loveland: Former Assistant Superintendent violated the law by using a district car.
Ghia Dheeh: The teacher's unions are bullies. Teach and educate, don't indoctrinate.
Jesse S.: Don't support the recall, they want to replace education with indoctrination.
Yolanda: Thanked board members Ledesma, Ortega, and Miner for protecting the rights of parents and the innocence of the students.
Lee Tousignant, OUSD parent: Wished all students and teachers an amazing school year. And the board needs to stop aiding in the
villainization of the teachers. His kids only have had amazing teachers.
Esther: Thanked board members Ledesma, Ortega, and Miner. Is against indoctrination.
Dawn: When you recall, you don't accept the election. Communist Marxists have infiltrated the schools.
