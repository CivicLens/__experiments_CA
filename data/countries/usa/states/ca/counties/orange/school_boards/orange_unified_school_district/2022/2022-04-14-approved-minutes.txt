4. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
Superintendent Hansen is pleased to report three financial transactions on the agenda tonight. One being external
funding for transitional kindergarten, one presentation on RDA (Redevelopment Agency fees) as well as the sale of our
measure-S bond. These are in our strategic plan for the efficient utilization of fiscal resources and we've been very
successful in Orange Unified over the past several years. Our attract and retain program has implemented over 4.2
million in annual revenues and it helped reduce out-of-district transfers by 380 students. We've also refinanced and
restructured outstanding debt for our other post-employment benefit fund in the amount of $20.9 million in savings to
our general fund. We committed to our measure-S bond measure a tax rate of $29 per $100,000 and since 2017 we've
been way under that at $16 per $100,000, resulting in the property owners benefiting from $23.1 million in savings. In
addition to that, we have efficiently used our resources with COVID funding to generate additional facility improvement in
the amount of $33.6 million and we continue to upgrade our transportation and facilities department with a total of $7.5
million in buses and fueling stations. Dr. Hansen is pleased with the effective and efficient use of capital resources and we
are pleased to have these three items on the agenda this evening and she thanked the staff for their incredible work.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Board President Yamasaki started off by saying we have a lot of resolutions to approve. Three weeks ago, Trustees
Moffat, Erickson, and Page attended the 4th district PTA administrator dinner with some of our cabinet members. Several
of our schools were recognized. Orange Unified is very fortunate to have incredible PTA support. The PTA volunteers
provide thousands of hours of support to our schools and raise much-needed funds to support our programs. Our
superintendent Dr. Hansen was surprised by being named the PTA 4th district Outstanding Administrator of the Year. Dr.
Hansen was recognized for her stellar leadership, dedication to students, and strong support of the PTA. 4th District is the
largest PTA district in California and compasses all of Orange County so this recognition is huge. Thank you to OUCPTA
and Sandy Davidson for nominating Dr. Hansen.
Mrs. Yamasaki congratulated three outstanding Orange Unified administrators of the year and thanked them for their
commitment: Director of Technology Services Tam Nguyen, Principal at Nohl Canyon Jeff Jones, and Executive Director of

Innovation and Excellence Joe Erven.
She also mentioned that the community is invited to join the celebrations at Nohl Canyon for their 50th
anniversary. Trustee Erickson and trustee Yamasaki attended the opening of the STEM room at Crescent elementary
where students showed them around. There was also a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Crescent kindergarten
playground.
In the 90s, Master Gunnery Sergeant James Fearns, United States Marine Corps, Retired, was instrumental in the
establishment of the Orange High School USMC JROTC. As a retired Marine and Orange Unified Board Member (19931997), he personally lobbied the Commandant of the Marine Corps to establish a JROTC unit at Orange High School. His
love for the Corps and the students of Orange High are legendary and memorialized in the establishment of the James H.
Fearns Marine Corps JROTC Memorial Scholarship fund, which is supported and administered by the Orange High School
Marine Corps JROTC Association. Board member Kathy Moffat, and I had the opportunity to interview and award
scholarships to JROTC students who exhibit leadership qualities, academic achievement, and a commitment to excellence
with Geoff Fears, President of the scholarship fund. We were both impressed by the two scholarship recipients. Mrs.
Yamasaki thanked the donors to this fund and especially Geoff Fearns for his ongoing support of the program and the
students. She also thanked Colonel Mark Tull, Senior Marine Instructor for his leadership and for rebuilding the program.
Trustee Erickson and President Yamasaki attended the Canyon High School Foundation Hall of Fame last month. She
thanked the attendees and donors for supporting the new Canyon High Student Center, the student programs, and the
athletic programs. They raised over $20,000 for the boosters and $20,000 for the student center. Four people were
inducted into the hall of fame: Retired principal Ralph Jameson, and Canyon alums Ayo Davis, Timothy Noble, and Erin
Volcan. Thank you to the Canyon Foundation for supporting our students.
She's also proud that Freddy Freeman, a former El Modena alumni, signed up to play with the Dodgers. He still visits the
El Modena field occasionally.
Information: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Orange High School Principal McCuistion is honored to introduce the 2022 ACSA Every Student Succeeding Award
Recipient Cesar Castro. This award is given to students who have overcome extreme obstacles in order to achieve
academic success. Cesar was nominated by Orange High School for this award due to his positive, resilient, and optimistic
character that he displayed while facing his challenge with Leukemia. Since his diagnosis in August 2020, Cesar has never
complained, felt sorry for himself, or made excuses in regard to his academics. Cesar has consistently kept a smile on his
face and has always been willing to go the extra mile in order to succeed academically. It is not surprising that he has
been chosen for this recognition. The Orange High School panther family is very proud of Cesar. On behalf of the Board,
Mrs. Yamasaki presented Cesar with the award. Cesar thanked his family for the support he received and his counselor
and principal for joining him tonight.
Board Member Angie Rumsey mentioned that as a teacher one of her favorite things is to go into another classroom. She
visited California elementary and she thanked principal Dr. Brunasso and the teachers for welcoming her and giving her a
tour. Mrs. Rumsey was very impressed with the Spanish immersion program and excited to see it in action. California
Elementary is also an Apple Distinguished school, something that is very difficult to accomplish and wishes them good
luck with renewing this status. She's happy leadership at the school and the district is listening to the parents regarding
their desire to have the school go up to sixth grade. They are exploring possibilities which include sending out a survey to
hear the parent's feedback on that.
Board Member Kathy Moffat was proud to participate in the Marine Corps Junior ROTC scholarship interviewing process. It
was inspiring to see the students and the great work they are doing. When she was at Orange High School, she asked
four students how they were enjoying their new science building. They told her how excited and happy they were. It was
very inspirational.
Board Vice-President Kris Erickson congratulated the IT Ed-tech department for organizing a successful eSport academy
event at Villa Park High School for approximately 120 K-6 students from 22 different elementary schools. It was a very
good opportunity for our younger students to experience the new STEM centers. Villa Park High School students were
assisting the younger students. It was a great experience. She also wanted to draw attention to the fact that on this day,
75 years ago, five parents including Lorenzo Ramirez of El Modena, won a federal lawsuit against several California school
districts, including El Modeno, that had segregated Mexican-American schoolchildren. This case was decided nine years
before Brown versus Board of Education and was critical in the fight against school segregation. At that time, California
segregated schools which allowed school districts to provide separate schools for Black, Native American, and Asian
children. When Lorenzo Ramirez's children were denied admission to his former school and forced to attend the local far
inferior Mexican school, Ramirez joined four families and filed a class-action suit against four school districts, including El
Modeno. For the first time in a federal court, they were permitted to argue segregation. The judge ruled in their favor and
ordered the discrimination stopped. The districts appealed but lost. Even though the judge didn't decide the constitutional
issues, which would be decided nine years later in Brown vs Board of Education, it was a catalyst for a major change in
California and the nation. We have to acknowledge and thank the five brave families, one from just around the corner
from where our students attend, who challenged injustice and prevailed, making a better place for all of us.
Board Clerk Ana Page studied Brown vs Board of Education as a student at Villa Park High School but the Mendez case
never came up until students started questioning and wanted to know what happened. When the students found out
about the Mendez case, they were surprised. Not only did this happen in Orange County but it started with five families
who looked just like us. Because of the efforts of families 75 years ago, our children can go to their local schools.
Mrs. Page attended a Mandarin duck feeding event at Eisenhower park organized by the Orange Mandarin Booster Club.
The many families that attended were speaking in Mandarin and she's looking forward to the Mandarin spring festival at

Villa Park High School. Trustees Erickson and Page attended the Orange High School performance of Grease. It was very
inspiring.
Student board member Eliana Lipson shared that the students at El Modena High School are enjoying the new science
building. Next week, there will be an international and spring sports assembly on campus, as well as the MORP dance and
a show by the dance company. Melissa Medina from Orange High School talked about the March madness event that was
held last month. They raised $10,000 for the leukemia/lymphoma society and yesterday they held a signing day for three
athletes.
Information: D. Board Recognition – “YOU'VE GOT THE EDGE” – Employee Of The Month Recognition Program
Dr. Hansen introduced Mark Labastida, Instructional Assistant from Parkside Adult Transition Program, who is the
recipient of the "You've got the Edge" - Employee of the Month Award for the month of April. Board President Yamasaki
read what the Parkside Staff had to say about Mark: "Mr. Labastida has always shown a great deal of care about our
students and has always put their needs first. Mark is a wonderful employee exemplifying respect and excellence in all he
does. Recently, Mark became aware of an Adult Transition student in his class choking on food and struggling to breathe.
He ran to the student and administered the Heimlich maneuver until the food became dislodged, and the student was
able to breathe again. This is just one example of Mark's dedication to the care and support he regularly provides to our
students. Our program at Parkside is incredibly lucky to have him. Mr. Labastida thanked the board for the honor. He also
thanked those who are not here but are part of the team at Parkside.
Information: E. Community Partnership Recognition: SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union
This quarter SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union has been selected for the Community Partnership Recognition to valuable
partnerships that exist between community organizations and the district. Specialist of School & Community Relations,
Carol Chaney, and Specialist of Membership Development, Jacinda Lazarus accepted the award on behalf of SchoolsFirst
Federal Credit Union. Mrs. Yamasaki stated the SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union has provided a myriad of opportunities
that have enhanced and enriched the academic success of our students. In addition, the generous support over the years
has enabled the school district to host a multitude of events for our classified, certificated, and leadership staff that
included recognition ceremonies and robust professional development opportunities. The district is very grateful for the
dedication and contributions that exemplify our District Core Values of Integrity, Equity, Respect, and Excellence.
Information: F. Board Proclamation: SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS’ DAY - APRIL 26, 2022

Trustee Moffat recognized the contributions of two community members. Mr. Mike Learakos, the owner of the restaurant
Katella Grill that sadly closed its doors this month. Mr. Learakos is driven by his desire to feed the hungry. He has also
worked with our culinary art program. Thank you to Mike Learakos. Mrs. Moffat also thanked Jeff Fearns, who is the son
of Jim Fearns, a former Orange Unified Board Member. Jeff Fearns supports and helps guide the Marine Junior RJOTC
