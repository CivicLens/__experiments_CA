Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Government Code Section 66001 and Section 66006 require local agencies, inclusive of school districts, to be
accountable and report ondeveloper fees that are collected and expended on both an annual and five-year basis.
The annual report focuses on the amount of developer fees collected by theDistrict and expended throughout the fiscal year. The
five-year report requires a more detailed analysis of the Districts overall use of developer fees. It is more efficientfor a school
districtto prepare a comprehensive report each fiscal year that includes both the annual and five-year collection and expenditure
information. By combining these two reports, there is securityagainst apotential penalty of refunding unexpended developer fees
for failure to timely report expenditures in the appropriate year.
Although not required by a resolution, the report findings are often made in the form of a resolution that is adopted by the
governing board to facilitate compliance with the requisite codes and regulations.
The annual report must be made within 180 days from the last day of the fiscal year. The five-year findings must be presented
for approval by the Governing Board in conjunction with an annual report. The completed reports and applicable findings must be
available for public review at least 15 days prior to approval by the governing board.

DESCRIPTION: On September 26, 2019, the Board approved the Transportation Department to enter into the San Joaquin
Valley Unified Air Pollution Control Districts Volkswagen Mitigation Trust Fund Transit Bus program and are in the process of
purchasing seven (7) electric-powered school buses as part of this grant process.

amount of $72,455. While Southern California Edison (SCE) will be installing much of the electric infrastructure through the
Charge Ready Transport (CRT) Program, the District will be responsible for installing the charging stations.
Baker Electric has submitted a proposal in the amount of $19,901 to the District to bolt down and install pedestal style EV
charging stations and Inter-Pacific, Inc. has submitted a proposal to trench, install conduit, and run Cat6A Ethernet cable to the
outdoor enclosure for the connection of the charging stations in the amount of $18,464.
The total fiscal impact to the District for this project, including an added contingency of $33,246, will be $145,000.
Transportation has reviewed pricing for the installation activities with the Facilities Department and staff believes the proposals to
be reasonable based on industry-standard pricing. Both vendors will be required to complete a Field Service Agreement and
must be pre-registered in the Districts California Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act (CUPCCAA) contractor
