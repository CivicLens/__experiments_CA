Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover
assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact.

potential impact on student achievement. Texts for CTE courses are previously approved by the Central County ROP/Career

DESCRIPTION: Assembly Bill 288 establishes the College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Act to authorize California
Community College Districts to enter into formal partnership agreements with local school districts to expand access to
concurrent enrollment opportunities for high school students. Concurrent enrollment is defined as credit hours earned when a
high school student is taking a college course for both high school and college credit, during the high school day, on the high
school campus. The goals of Assembly Bill 288 encompass the following:

1. Expand access to concurrent enrollment programs for students through the authorization of college courses being offered
on a high school campus exclusively to high school students

2. Increase exposure to the rigor of college coursework and environments for underserved students
3. Accelerate learning for students by developing a framework that enables students who demonstrate competency to up to
15 units of community college coursework instead of the 11 units

4. Build pathways that fill projected labor market needs and are relevant to the targeted student population
5. Promote accountability for student learning by granting school districts more authority to monitor a students progress and
obtain academic records from the collaborating community college
OUSD, in collaboration with Saddleback College, will be entering into a CCAP Partnership Agreement to offer students the
opportunity to enroll in the Horticulture Landscape Design Program.

The item will be brought back at the April 16, 2020 Board meeting as a public hearing for adoption of the resolution.
