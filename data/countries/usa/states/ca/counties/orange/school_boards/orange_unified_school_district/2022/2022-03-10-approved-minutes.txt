4. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
A video on the new El Modena High School Science Center was shown. Dr. Hansen thanked the community for the
support. She also thanked the communication team for putting the video together.
Recently we participated in the grand opening of a brand new baseball field at Anaheim Hills Elementary school that was
put together for Little League and the students of the school, in collaboration with the City of Anaheim and the Angels
foundation. A video was shown to share the event and the new asset for the children. Mrs. Yamasaki thanked the
communications teams for making these videos that captured the spirit of the events.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Mrs. Yamasaki started off by saying it's great to see the COVID case rates go down and that schools are able to return to
a situation where students can focus on learning and the district can focus on education. Field trips and sports are

returning. The El Modena ribbon-cutting event was great. It was wonderful to see all the community members come out
and celebrate. This represents the fourth of four phase-one projects and we are more than halfway. Mrs. Yamasaki is
looking forward to what phase two brings.
We were honored to have our local congresswoman Katie Porter visit our transportation yard. Orange Unified is one of the
first school districts to procure electric buses. Director Mrs. Celeste-Russo gave a presentation about the features of the
new buses and how they were able to obtain grants. This board recently approved the charging stations and installation.
Mrs. Yamasaki thanked the Transportation Team. She also thanked Mr. Harvey and Mr. Nguyen for working on the
infrastructure of the charging stations. She thanked the staff for providing the training that includes the bus drivers and
the mechanics, and the finance team for looking at external funding. Mrs. Yamasaki is very proud of the accomplishments
our district has made.
State Superintendent Thurmond joined us for the fourth year in a row for Read across America day at Jordan Elementary.
Mrs. Yamasaki, Mrs. Page, and Mrs. Erickson were also in attendance to read and celebrate this day.
It's a tradition in our district to invite community members to be Principal of the Day at each of our school sites. Mrs.
Yamasaki was principal at Canyon Rim Elementary School. She visited many classrooms and she had an opportunity to
observe how technology was being utilized. At the end of the day, all principals virtually got together and discussed the
day.
Mrs. Yamasaki addressed a speaker that attended last month's meeting. This speaker talked about the climate survey.
Mrs. Yamasaki said the school staff followed up with the speaker, and the board was updated in their Friday letter. The
survey did not contain the information that the speaker claimed. She encourages parents to contact the principals to see
the survey. The survey also needs parental permission.
Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Board Vice President Erickson thanked president Yamasaki for going over all these incredible events. It's been great to go
to all the schools and events. She attended the Lunar celebration at Fletcher. It was very exciting to have State
Superintendent Public Instruction Tony Thurmond at Jordan Academy. There are 1000 school districts in California and for
the 4th year in a row, he chose our district to come to. It is very special how dedicated he is to our district. The El
Modena Science Center opening was incredible. Mrs. Erickson thanked everyone who had a part in it and voted for it.
We've added 200,000 square feet of new learning space and 71 new classrooms in our district just in phase one. That's a
big accomplishment and we have a lot of people to thank for it.
Board Clerk Ana Page mentioned Read across America week was very special on every campus. On the last day of the
week, she visited California elementary. With the preschoolers, she did a lot of music and movement but as they went on
to the older kids, they talked with the students about how to be helpers in the community. It was great to celebrate the
Lunar New Year at Fletcher Elementary with the students and parents.
Board Member Moffat talked about the opening of the El Modena Science Center. It was a fantastic event with a lot of
pride and joy. She is very grateful to the community for supporting Measure S which made this all possible. She loved
seeing the kids excited because that's why we do this.
Mrs. Moffat is proud of how Orange Unified has weathered this pandemic by opening early with learning in classrooms
and virtual without any school closures. She is grateful for all the dedicated teachers. She had several conversations with
Dr. Hansen about the climate survey. She's thankful for the conversations and the open mind about how to improve the
survey.
Board Member Ortega is shocked about the situation in the Ukraine. He asked everybody to do what they can, be
supportive, and please keep those people in mind. It's truly unfortunate that we are a district of exclusion and not
inclusion. We have kids sitting outside in hallways, not being able to take a test, marked truant. We are supposed to be of
students first. He hopes a lot of the parents, as he suggested, come and speak and write to the superintendent and
Assistant Superintendent Corella about this. This should not be happening in our school district. Unfortunately, this is
taking place and our staff and principals are allowing this to take place. Mr. Ortega will not stand for it. We've been
arguing about choice this whole time. If an employee needs to be corrected, that needs to go to Mr. Gonzalez in Human
Resources. We learned how to move along and adjust and how to integrate. Mr. Ortega believes the survey needs to be
put on the website. It should be open to the public as to what we are asking our students to do and asking our parents to
approve. Taxpayers need to see what we are paying for. We have nothing to hide. Staff and students should be protected
at all costs and if he keeps hearing about these issues, we will keep hearing from him at the board meetings.
Board Member Ledesma would like to make a comment about one of the kids not being allowed to participate in Read
across America day because he was not wearing a mask. He urged the superintendent to get together with Mr. Ortega to
get the specifics, especially on the individual students and teachers, and do a real investigation. How can this happen?
Why? There must be some miscommunication somewhere.
Mrs. Yamasaki would like to add that we are invited to speak to our superintendent at any time with questions or
concerns. In fact, before every board meeting, she puts out a phone call to all the board members to discuss questions
and concerns, and not all board members reply. She has always been accessible.
Board Member Mrs. Rumsey feels it's important the District is transparent in the future and has the survey accessible to
the parents. The board did receive all the questions in the Friday update along with a statement there was some
misinformation. The misinformation feels like hearsay on both sides so it's hard to make a determination on that. It's a
sensitive issue when a small child is being asked questions. In today's world, there are very sensitive topics that are
brought up to small children which makes it an extra sensitive area. In terms of masks, she is so glad to have the option
starting on Monday. She hopes that schools have acceptance to mask wearers and those that choose not to wear a mask.
We need to just focus on learning and best practices.

Since there has been some conversation about the climate survey, Mrs. Moffat would like to say the following: the
protocol requires active, affirmative permission by the parent before the student takes the survey. Every parent has an
opportunity to understand what is on that survey before their child sees it and takes it. That was the process and that will
be the process in the future. No child takes that survey without the permission of the parent.
Information: D. Board Recognition – “YOU'VE GOT THE EDGE” – Employee Of The Month Recognition Program
Dr. Hansen introduced Mary Shamamian, Counselor at McPherson Magnet School, who is the recipient of the "You've got
the Edge" - Employee of the Month Award for the month of March. Board President Yamasaki read what the McPherson
staff Administration had to say about Mary: Mary demonstrates all four of OUSD's core values in her daily work as our
school counselor. Mary is generous with her time and always makes decisions that support the best interest of kids. Mary
is a kind person who genuinely cares about the people around her and takes pride in the work that she does. She
coaches every season of middle school sports and she greets and welcomes elementary students at the gate each
morning. She does all of these things and more with consistency and passion because she cares deeply for her students,
colleagues, and profession. Mary is a person with outstanding character and professionalism and we are so grateful to
have her as a counselor at McPherson and an employee of OUSD. Congratulations Mary, The board of Education thanks
you for your dedication and devotion to Orange Unified.
Information: E. State of the School Report: Evelyn Melgoza- Villa Park High School
Student Board Member Evelyn Melgoza from Villa Park High School introduces herself. A video was shown on SEL (social
& emotional learning) on the campus. Evelyn thanked all those that supported her in the making of the video and those
that joined her this evening, including the ASB students, Principal Dr. Miller, and ASB Director Hedspeth.
Information: F. Innovation and Excellence Report
Executive Director Mr. Erven presented the item and a video on Project Lead the Way, a STEM-based curriculum for TK-12

Information: A. Board / Staff Conference and Comments
Board Member Moffat commented that this was a distressing meeting. It was disappointing and not up to our standards.
She felt the need to say that Mrs. Erickson is one of the kindest, most generous, and highly principled people that she
knows. She is devoted to the children or Orange Unified and gives generously of herself to the schools and the
community for the good of us as a whole. She is extraordinarily competent. She is intellectually brilliant, fair-minded with
a heart for the underdog and the underserved. Mrs. Erickson takes her job on this school board seriously, something we
can all learn from and admire. She always reads all the information and has prepared herself for responsible board
service by completing CSBA's Masters in Governance. She visits all the schools, and she attends all the important school

district events. She studies all the issues we deal with on the school board. Mrs. Erickson respects the roles and the
individuals who serve Orange Unified as our superintendent and our administrators. She follows proper and respectful
and universally recommended protocols for school board trustees. She calls the superintendent with questions and
concerns prior to board meetings to discuss on a professional and respectful level. She would never seek to disparage or
embarrass our superintendent or other staff members. To behave any other way is bullying, has no place on this dias,
and no place in a meeting of the school board in a district of excellence like Orange Unified. We owe it to our students,
families, and community members to act like serious, respectable adults at our meetings. We owe it to them so that they
can properly understand the high level of professionalism and competency in our staff and thus the high level of
education in our classrooms. Everyone on this board would do well to emulate Mrs. Erickson. She is an ideal board
member worthy of our praise and worthy of our following of her example. Mrs. Moffat is proud to serve with her. Mrs.
Moffat wants this statement in the minutes.
Mr. Ledesma asked to not include this statement in the minutes as it is politicking from the dias and that should not be
happening.
