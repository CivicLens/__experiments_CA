Goals :

4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The Gann Amendment provides a ceiling, or limit, on each years appropriations of tax dollars by each taxreceiving agency, including the state, cities, counties, school districts, and special districts. Proposition 4, an initiative passed in
November 1979, added controls on the growth in appropriations (Article XIII-B of the California Constitution). Using 1978-79 as a
base year, subsequent year appropriations limit has been adjusted for: (1) An inflation increase equal to the change in the
Consumer Price Index, or per capita personal income, whichever is smaller, and (2) the change in the population, which for
school agencies is the change in ADA. Proposition 111 was adopted in June 1990 and amended the Gann Limit inflation factor
to be based only on the change in per capita personal income.
The starting point for the 2021-22Gann Limit calculation is the agency's 2020-21Gann Limit which has increased by this year's
inflation factor and by the District's percentage increase in ADA. A second calculation is made to determine those revenues that
are subject to the limit, and ensure that a school agency is not over its limits.Not all revenue sources count against the District's
Gann Limit. Gann Limits only constrain the appropriations from state and local tax sources, and so federal aid is excluded as well
as non-tax income, such as revenues from cafeteria sales or adult education fees. It is by virtue of this calculation that almost
every school district and county office of educations expenditures are exactly at theirGann Limit. Orange Unified School District
is no exception.
In accordance with Article XIII-B of the California Constitution, a resolution must be adopted annually regarding the
appropriations limit for current and preceding fiscal years. Approval of this resolution will fulfill that requirement.
RECOMMENDATION: It is recommended that the Board of Education adopt Resolution No. 11-21-22, Gann Amendment
Appropriations Limit, for the current and preceding fiscal years in accordance with Article XIII-B of the California Constitution.
FISCAL IMPACT: The item has no fiscal impact.

Category :

12. CONSENT ITEMS - HUMAN RESOURCES

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of

waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover
assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.
FISCAL IMPACT:This item has no fiscal impact.
