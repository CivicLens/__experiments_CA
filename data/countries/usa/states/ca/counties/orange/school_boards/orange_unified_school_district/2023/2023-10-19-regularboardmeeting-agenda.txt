Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education take action
to approve the Memorandum of Understanding between
Orange Unified School District and Orange Unified
Education Association.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The Orange Unified School District (District) is facing an acute shortage of substitute teachers. Qualified and
competent substitute teachers are necessary to insure the continuity of instructional services when regular teachers are absent.
The attached Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is designed to insure that the students of the District receive the best
educational support available when regular teachers are absent by, among other things, providing economic incentives to the
Districts current staff to: (1) cover the classes of absent teachers during preparation periods at the secondary levels; and (2)
provide for the distribution of the students of absent teachers to other regular teachers at the elementary sites.
The District has an existing budget for substitute teachers and the MOU is designed to keep the cost of the incentives provided
for in this MOU within the existing budget for substitutes. It is possible that such costs could exceed the current budget but any
excess would be minimal and any such excess is more than offset by the value of having current staff serve the educational
needs of students whose teachers are absent or otherwise unavailable.
FISCAL IMPACT: No increase to current budget

Category :

12. CONSENT ITEMS - HUMAN RESOURCES

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable-term. Short-term waivers give the districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term needs.
This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential authorization for
one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover assignments
when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while searching for an
individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It also allows the
individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

FISCAL IMPACT:This item has no fiscal impact on the district.
