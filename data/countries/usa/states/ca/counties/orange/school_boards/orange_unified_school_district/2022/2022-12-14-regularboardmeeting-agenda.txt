Public Content

DESCRIPTION:Government Code Sections 66001 and 66006 require local agencies, including school districts, to report
ondeveloper fees that are collected and expended on both an annual and five-year basis.
The annual report focuses on the amount of developer fees collected by theDistrict and expended throughout the fiscal year. The
five-year report requires a more detailed analysis of the Districts overall use of developer fees. It is more efficientfor a school
districtto prepare a comprehensive report each fiscal year that includes both the annual and five-year collection and expenditure
information. By combining these two reports, there is securityagainst apotential penalty of refunding unexpended developer fees
for failure to timely report expenditures in the appropriate year.
Although not required by a resolution, the report findings are often made in the form of a resolution that is adopted by the
governing board to facilitate compliance with the requisite codes and regulations.
The annual report must be made within 180 days from the last day of the fiscal year. The five-year findings must be presented
for approval by the Governing Board in conjunction with an annual report. The completed reports and applicable findings must be
available for public review at least 15 days prior to approval by the governing board.

or will change plans during the 2023 year. In other words, the employee will pay the lower rate of either the 2022 or 2023
published certificated employee rates applicable to their 2023 plan.
The Districts Agency Negotiator met with representatives of the District leadership employees and has communicated that the
compensation terms agreed to by the parties for certificated employees are being recommendedto the Board of Education for
application to leadership employees.
The terms contained in this item have been negotiated by the Districts Agency Negotiator consistent with Board authorization.

DESCRIPTION:The accountancy firm of Nigro & Nigrowill present information from the 2021-22 audit report. The Education
Code requires that the independent audit be submitted to the State Controllers Office, federal agencies, and the Orange County
Department of Education. The State Controllers Office reviews each independent audit and approves or disapproves the audit
report within three to four months of receipt. The independent audit report for 2021-22 will be filed with the state by December
15, 2022.
The general objectives of an audit are to determine whether: (1) the districts financial statements are presented fairly in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (2) there is effective district control over and proper accounting for
revenues, expenditures, assets, and liabilities; (3) state and federal reports and claims for advances or reimbursements contain
accurate and reliable financial data and are presented in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements; and (4) state and
federal funds are being expended in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements and those provisions of law or
regulations that could have a material effect on the financial statements and or on the awards that were tested.
The independent audit of the 2021-22 District fiscal records indicates a positive financial status and ongoing maintenance and
improvement of appropriate internal controls. The ending balances for all funds have been verified to be those previously stated
in the Districts Standardized Account Code Structure (SACS) Financial Reporting documents on file with the California
Department of Education and those indicated in the independent accounting system of the Orange County Department of
Education, which maintains ledgers on all payroll, warrant, and financial transactions of any sort of each school district located
within Orange County.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education take action
to approve the Memorandum of Understanding between
Orange Unified School District and Orange Unified
Education Association.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The Orange Unified School District (District) is facing an acute shortage of substitute teachers. Qualified and
competent substitute teachers are necessary to insure the continuity of instructional services when regular teachers are absent.
The attached Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is designed to insure that the students of the District receive the best
educational support available when regular teachers are absent by, among other things, providing economic incentives to the
Districts current staff to: (1) cover the classes of absent teachers during preparation periods at the secondary levels; and (2)
provide for the distribution of the students of absent teachers to other regular teachers at the elementary sites.
The District has an existing budget for substitute teachers and the MOU is designed to keep the cost of the incentives provided
for in this MOU within the existing budget for substitutes. It is possible that such costs could exceed the current budget but any
excess would be minimal and any such excess is more than offset by the value of having current staff serve the educational
needs of students whose teachers are absent or otherwise unavailable.
FISCAL IMPACT: No increase to current budget

Category :

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content

DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover
assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact.
