Recommended Action :

It is recommended the Board of Education approve the

Goals :

4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Board Policy (BP 4000) sets forth the concept that the District is to maintain conditions in employment "that will
attract and retain the best qualified personnel for all positions." Board Policy (BP 2100)
also requires that District administrative staff be organized in a manner that best supports the educational program through
efficient operations, effective communications, and direct assistance to schools.
Based upon these standards and the needs of the District as presented to the Board, it is recommended that the Transportation
Department be reorganized as described below for the 2023-2024 school year with new position assignments to be effective July
1, 2023, or as soon as is permitted by statute, policy, and/or Collective Bargaining Agreement.
It is intended that any classified position elimination recommendations connected with this process be addressed through
attrition, so that no layoffs are contemplated by this recommended action.
The Orange Unified School District Transportation Department supports approximately 26,500 students. For the 2022-2023
school year, there are 78 routes transporting 1800 students throughout the District. The Transportation Department successfully
transports over 1200 field/sport/activity trips each school year and travels approximately 1.3 million miles per year. The
Transportation Department has a fleet of 120 school buses and employs over 130 staff members (School Bus Drivers, School
Bus Driver Instructors, Instructional Assistants, Mechanics, Office Staff, Leadership, etc.).
The recommendations associated with this reorganization are based on the changing transportation needs in OUSD, as well as
current trends in staffing in the field of transportation.
RECOMMENDATION: It is recommended the Board of Education approve the reconfiguration of the Transportation Department
as follows:
- Increase hours of service of 96classified unit positions, Bus Driver, from 6 hour to 7 hours (Salary range 34);
- Increase days of service of 82classified unit positions, Bus Driver, from 9.5 month to 10 month (Salary range 34);
- Eliminate seven classified unit positions, Bus Driver (9.5 months, salary range 34);
- Add one classified unit position, Bus Driver (12 months, salary range 34);
- Add one new classified unit position, Lead School Bus Driver/Instructor (12 months, salary range 48);
- Add five new classified unit positions, Lead School Bus Driver (salary range 40);
- Increase salary range of three classified unit positions, School Bus Driver/Instructor from salary range 37 to salary range 44;
- Eliminate one classified unit position, Heavy Duty Mechanic (12 months, salary range 44);
- Add one new classified unit position, Lead Multi-Fleet Technician (12 months, salary range 48);
- Increase salary range of one classified unit position, Vehicle Maintenance Foreman from salary range 47 to salary range 52;
- Add one new classified supervisor position, Transportation Field Supervisor (12 months, salary range L45);
- Reclassify classified supervisor position, Transportation Supervisor (12 months, salary range L52) to Transportation Manager
(12 month, salary range L68).
FISCAL IMPACT: It is estimated there will be a $1,472,994 difference from our current staffing model to the proposed staffing
model listed above, to be paid for from the transportation grant. Proposed $10,613,537

Current ($9,008,543)
Summer School Cost Savings ($132,000)

4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: On December 15, 2020, the Board approved the Transportation Department to work with Southern California
Edison (SCE) to install electric infrastructure through the Charge Ready Transport (CRT) Program. The District's current electric
infrastructure included 15 Level 2 AC charging stations and was completed in February 2022. This infrastructure has been used
to successfully charge the District's 15 electric school buses.
On July 21, 2022, the Board approved the Transportation Department to apply through the SCE CRT Program for a second time.
SCE has approved our program application and has awarded the contract for the second phase of the electric infrastructure. The
next phase will upgrade and expand the electric infrastructure to include an additional 16 charging stations (13 Level 2 AC
chargers and 3 Level 3 DC chargers). The District has been working with SCE on conceptual designs to expedite the second
phase project. Upgrading and expanding the electric infrastructure will allow the District to acquire more electric school buses in
the future as grant funding for the purchase of new school buses becomes available. Work of this scope could have cost the
District over $1.2 million. The award of the grant offsets the District costs by $900,000.
The eligibility requirements to maintain the infrastructure in good standing for SCE's CRT Program are: lease, purchase, or
convert at least two medium or heavy-duty battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs); own or lease the property where chargers
are installed, and operate and maintain chargers for a minimum of 10 years; select, purchase, and install SCE-approved
charging equipment; provide data related to charging equipment usage for a minimum of five years (on-road vehicles only);
provide a property easement for the SCE infrastructure; and agree to program terms and conditions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: District staff recommends the Board approve Resolution 26-22-23 authorizing acceptance of the grant in
the amount of approximately $900,000.
FISCAL IMPACT: Grant award $900,000 (Rivera/Celeste-Russo)

DESCRIPTION: At the May 5, 2022 board meeting, the Board approved a resolution authorizing the District to become a
member of theEducation Technology Joint Powers Authority (EdTech JPA). The District requested approval to join because
EdTech JPA acts as a procurement vehicle for technology goods and allows EdTech JPA Members to leverage contracts
established through the Request for Proposal (RFP) process, thus alleviating Members administrative costs and overhead. Each
EdTech JPA contract leveraged by the District must be Board approved and executed prior to any obligation to the District.
There was no cost to join the JPA. The District sought approval for a one-year term. The agreement, however, provides that
membership automatically renews from year to year on the same terms and conditions, unless terminated earlier by either party.
The District is requesting the Board's approval to continue with the contract as an automatic renewal, from year to year.
FISCAL IMPACT: Savings are anticipated due to the nature of consortium pricing (Rivera/Sanchez)

DESCRIPTION:Textbooks and supplementary instructional texts are reviewed by teacher committees from respective grade

up of representative teachers and staff from elementary, middle, and high schools. In addition, there are site administrators from
all school levels and central office administrators on the Council. The DCC is an advisory council that addresses universal and
specific issues that either directly or indirectly impact the curriculums offered in the Orange USD schools. The Council will make
recommendations to the Superintendent and Board of Education after thoroughly researching and discussing each issue and
potential impact on student achievement. Texts for CTE courses are previously approved by the Central County ROP/Career
Technical Education Partnership (CTEp).
It is at this juncture that the Board of Education places the texts and/or supplementary texts on a "30-day review period" so
