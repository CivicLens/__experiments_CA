Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
Resolution 30-22-23 designating certain general funds as
committed fund balances.

Goals :

4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Proposition 98 regulates school district funding. In 2014, Proposition 2 was passed limiting the levels for
Proposition 98 reserves. If the state reserve levels exceed 3% of the total Proposition 98 expenditures for TK-12, that triggers a
10% cap on local district reserves. If a district has reserve funds exceeding 10%, the overage must be designated for other
purposes, with those purposes specified for the Board to review and approve through a resolution. The 2021-22 state budget act
triggered the reserve cap. Thus, the District, through Resolution 30-22-23, is providing a list of designated uses for the overage
for the Board's approval for the 2023-24 fiscal year.
FISCAL IMPACT: None.

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which allow school districts to employ or assign persons
who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of waivers;
short-term and variable-term. Short-Term Waivers give the districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term needs. This
waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential authorization for one
semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover assignments when a
fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while searching for an
individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It also allows the
individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.
