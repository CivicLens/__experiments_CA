Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Board Member Moffat had the pleasure to attend an assembly at La Veta Elementary for the Angels
Adopt-a-School program. Anaheim Angels pitcher Griffin Canning and radio host Rodger Lodge visited
the school. Canning was very charming and inspiring. He was a perfect role model. The Villa Park High
School annual pancake breakfast drew in a lot of community participation. It was, as always, a nice
event.
Board Clerk Page also attended the breakfast at Villa Park High School. The Orange Mandarin Booster
Club hosted their spring festival, celebrating the Year of the Tiger, at Villa Park High School with student
performances, a line dance, and a fashion show. Mrs. Page shared her deep and sincere thanks to all of
the kindergarten teachers. This is the first year in Orange County that all public school kindergarten
teachers supported collecting our early developing index which is collecting information about our
youngest students in five different categories: physical health, social competence, emotional maturity,
language and cognitive skills, and communications skills and general knowledge. With this information,
we can analyze how students are school ready, and how we can continue to support them in their early
years. On Wednesday nights, there is parent education in Orange Unified, hosted by Positive Discipline.
She hopes families are able to participate.
Board Vice President Erickson wished all teachers a happy teacher appreciation week. She recognized
what an incredibly difficult year this was and she's very grateful for our teachers. This is a busy time of
year. She attended the Bus driver celebration and the eSports event that IT put together for K-6
students. Students learned how to game in a healthy way. It also combined art and technology. She also
mentioned the Digital Media Collaborative at El Modena High School. This career-focused program that
students participate in for 3 years, has a mentorship program and a professional internship. It's also
part of the CTE marketing pathway. She ordered shirts from the program and she was impressed with
the quality.
Student Board member Eliana Lipson from El Modena High School mentioned that Dance will have its
last showcase of the year. They will also have PROM, a goodbye assembly, and the Spring into the Arts
Festival. There will also be senior activities and graduation.
Orange High School representative mentioned they will have PROM. The students are also preparing for
