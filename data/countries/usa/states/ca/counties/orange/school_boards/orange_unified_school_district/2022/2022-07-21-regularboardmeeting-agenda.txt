Opportunities Program has been established to provide funding for afterschool and summer school enrichment programs for
transitional kindergarten/kindergarten through sixth grade as described in Education Code Section 46120 and established by
Assembly Bill 130. It is the intent of the Legislature that the LEA offer comprehensive after school and intercession expanded
learning opportunities to at least 50% of all unduplicated pupils in TK/K-6 classroom-based programs and shall ensure that
access is provided to any unduplicated pupil whose parent or guardian requests placement in the program. The ELO-P in the
Orange Unified School District has been created through partnerships between schools and local community organizations to
develop the academic, social, emotional, and physical needs and interests of students through hands-on, engaging learning
experiences and extracurricular activities. It is intended to be student-centered, results driven, include community partners, and
complement, but not replicate, learning activities in the regular school day and school year. When program requirements are
fulfilled for elementary school students, middle school students may be also be similarly served.

purchase, or convert at least two medium or heavy-duty battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs); own or lease the property
where chargers are installed, and operate and maintain chargers for a minimum of 10 years;select, purchase, and install SCEapproved charging equipment; provide data related to charging equipment usage for a minimum of five years (on-road vehicles
only); provide a property easement for the SCE infrastructure; and agree to program terms and conditions.

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve

the Teacher Assignment/Consent Report as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Individual school districts are responsible to provide their respective county superintendent of schools with
evidence of legal and appropriate assignments for all certificated employees. Legal and appropriate assignments for certificated
employees are those based upon the authorization(s) contained on the specific certificate(s) held by the certificated employee,
as well as additional assignments which are authorized assignment options by the Education Code.
Most of the assignment options provided by the Education Code allow a teacher to serve in an additional assignment, provided
that the teacher has received a specified level of training relative to the subject area to be taught, that the teacher consents to
the assignment, and that the local governing board takes action on the assignment. These assignment options are typically
employed in middle schools and high schools where the teacher is assigned to instruct groups of students in a specific subject
matter area or areas.
The teachers/assignments listed on the attached Teacher Assignment/Consent Report reflect legal and appropriate assignments
based upon authorized assignment options in the Education Code where the teacher has met all requirements and has
consented to the assignment.

OR SHORT-TERM WAIVER

Meeting :

Category :

12. CONSENT ITEMS - HUMAN RESOURCES

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content

DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover
assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact.

(2012 base API) during the 2020-2021 school year was shared with the board at the November 18, 2021 meeting. The report
provided that there were no findings in the areas of sufficiency of textbooks and instructional materials, maintenance of facilities,

Assignment Monitoring data for the 2020-21 school year. This data has now been received and thus is being shared as required.
