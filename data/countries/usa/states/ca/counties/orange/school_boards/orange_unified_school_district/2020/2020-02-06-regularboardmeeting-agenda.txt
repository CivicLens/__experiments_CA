Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the Teacher Assignment/Consent Report as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Individual school districts are responsible to provide their respective county superintendent of schools with
evidence of legal and appropriate assignments for all certificated employees. Legal and appropriate assignments for certificated
employees are those based upon the authorization(s) contained on the specific certificate(s) held by the certificated employee,
as well as additional assignments which are authorized assignment options by the Education Code.
Most of the assignment options provided by the Education Code allow a teacher to serve in an additional assignment, provided
that the teacher has received a specified level of training relative to the subject area to be taught, that the teacher consents to
the assignment, and that the local governing board takes action on the assignment. These assignment options are typically
employed in middle schools and high schools where the teacher is assigned to instruct groups of students in a specific subject
matter area or areas.
The teachers/assignments listed on the attached Teacher Assignment/Consent Report reflect legal and appropriate assignments
based upon authorized assignment options in the Education Code where the teacher has met all requirements and has
consented to the assignment.
