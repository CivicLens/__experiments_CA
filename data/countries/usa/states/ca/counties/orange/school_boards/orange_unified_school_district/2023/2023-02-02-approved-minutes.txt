4. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
Gabe Mejia: listen to the public, collaborate, and bring forward decisions that benefit our community; Beth Cipres: book on Sora app was
mistakenly mislabeled by the publisher, suspending the app is not the answer; Melanie polack, OUSD parent, removal of the app is
unacceptable; David Lieberman, OUSD parent: no censoring, no age level needed, parents need to monitor.
Interim Superintendent Velasquez explained the issues the district experiences with the Sora Library app. Four books were improperly
classified and were reassigned to the correct grade. There was a glitch with the data synchronization between student devices and the
app. This issue has been addressed. Finally, a default setting in the app allowed uncategorized accounts to have access to all levels of
content. This has since changed to default to the lowest level of content as a safeguard. The app will be reinstated. Mr. Velasquez also
expressed his hope that parents are aware of and speak to their children about the types of media they are consuming, both at school
and at home.
Mr. Velasquez answered Ms. Erickson's question about the number of times a specific book that was labeled middle and high school was
checked out. There were ten checkouts at the middle and high school levels and the book was checked out four times by what is believed
the same account at the elementary school level. There have been only two complaints about SORA since 2014, one in 2022 and one in
2023. The app and the book will be back tomorrow with controls. Trustee Yamasaki asked to bring an agenda item to the next meeting to
discuss the Sora app.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Board President Ledesma played a recording of a public comment about a mislabeled book from the previous board meeting. Mr. Ledesma
asked to not politicize this problem with the Sora app. It is not about book banning but about giving parents a say. We are going to have

parental control. He also mentioned there are many issues to address: a review of all apps and their content, setting up parent controls,
approval committee, academic audit, special education, and test scores. Professional development contractor Orenda will not continue
with the district at their request. We are looking forward to potentially continuing this professional development with our teachers and
administrators to keep costs down and better serve our students.
Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Trustee Erickson stated that parents get to choose for themselves and Trustee Ledesma just chose for them by reading an
inappropriate book. There have only been two complaints about the Sora app since 2014. Ms. Erickson visited Santiago Middle School.
The assembly was so much fun. It was a heartwarming and fun event. These students care about their fellow students. They supported a
sick student by holding cupcake sales, making posters, and raising funds. Imperial students showed them around the school. The
students mentioned they wanted a musical theater program at the elementary level. The Fletcher Lunar celebration event will be held at
Chapman University tomorrow night.
Trustee Yamasaki gave a shoutout to Mr. Larios for showing the wonderful Vila Park High School graphic design room at the showcase. All
the Orange Unified feeder schools attended the showcase. Santiago Canyon College was there as well. The next showcase is at El
Modena. Ms. Yamasaki visited the Lunar New Year dress rehearsal at Fletcher.
Trustee Miner was horrified by an inappropriate book being available to young kids. She visited many sites. It was wonderful to see the
teachers in action but teachers are not everywhere. Ms. Miner favors the Sora app and is happy it's coming back. She mentioned the
highlights of all her school site visits.
Trustee Page visited the Santiago assembly with Ms. Erickson. It was wonderful to see the school culture. She enjoyed her visits to
Canyon Hills and Imperial Elementary. Ms. Page is excited about the Lunar New Year Celebration at Chapman University where her child is
performing. It's amazing to see students learn a different language.
Trustee Rumsey stated that kids need access to books but with parental control. It is time to move forward. New leadership brings new
opportunities and new systems. Teachers care about their students and parents trust this district and the teacher to deliver a curriculum
that is comprehensive and rigorous. She wants to put the best curriculum in the hands of teachers and administration and empower
parents to make decisions surrounding their child's faith and social issues. We need to move forward, come together and provide a firstclass education for our students.
Trustee Ortega is excited about the construction happening on various sites. He mentioned that it's good to see Orenda ending the
services. This will save money so we can provide that as stipends to staff and teachers, those who know our students best.
Mr. Ortega mentioned that pausing the Sora app is not about banning books but putting a safeguard in place. It will return with parental
controls in place.
El Modena Student Board Member Ruby Hewitt talked about the mini club rush that was held on campus. A lot of new students
joined the various clubs. The showcase will be held next week and she's excited about that. There is a cheer showcase this weekend. This
is a great way for local studios to connect with the high schools. Boys basketball is playing now. They already won the title. Both Boy's
and Girl's wrestling teams went to CIF. ASB started a coffee shop on campus on Wednesday morning. The money will be used for starting
clubs.
Canyon High School Student Board Member Madison Salloum talked about last week's pep rally that ASB put on and got all students
together. There is a blood drive next week. Kindness week coming up for Valentine's. ASB makes hearts for every student of the school to
make every student feels welcome.
Villa Park Substitute Student Board Member Alex Tran mentioned the Villa Park HS showcase. There were tours of the school. The
local colleges and the National Guard were present. The dance team hosted an event with young students and they all had the
opportunity to cheer at the basketball game. All Villa Park winter sports made it to CIF this year, which is a great honor. Prom will be held
on May 13th. He mentioned the basketball rivalry game between Canyon and Villa Park High schools that is going on tonight.
Information: D. State of the School Report: Diego Paz - Orange High School

Executive Director, Student & Community Services Heriberto Angel introduced Diego Paz. In his State of the School Report,
Student Board Member of Orange High School, Diego Paz shared a video that showed students from many different
backgrounds. It's the oldest high school in the district with a rich history filled with tradition and pride. Diego thanked ASB
Teams Editor-in-chief Christopher Pineda for his work on editing the video.

Tamara Rivera, OUSD parent: civility problem is everywhere. Use the civility clause that was voted on. Erinne Meja: extremist voices are

OUSD shows district-wide growth in all performances on the Dashboard. OUSD won many awards. OUSD is doing well.
Courtney: commends the board for suspending the Sora app. Some books should not be available at all. Amanda K: OUSD parent, the

endearment are condescending and patronizing and should not be used in the workplace. Rosa Otero: Mija is part of the culture and part

We should be working together. Everybody should have equal education.
Kris Jackson: in support of the new board majority. Mia M: in support of the audit. Supports parental rights. Alex Brewsaugh: OUSD
parent, he put in a Brown act suit. It's the intent of the law that actions of local public agencies be taken openly. People have the right of
access to information. Meetings need to be open to the public. Jennie Sloan: OUSd parent, comments on 5:30 pm public comments
procedure. The agenda was too vague. Karen Tadros, OUSD parent: has complete trust in the schools. What happened in OUSD is
happening everywhere. Take over school boards, take over schools. All children should have access to a solid education. Don't politicize.
JJ Meis, OUSD parent: keep state and church separated, no prayer circles at the District Office. Objects to language that is being used to
promote these prayer circles. Michelle Weisenberg: there is so much chaos in the District going on right now. Lies about sex ed

Thanks OUSD for giving everybody school options. To the Hispanic community: participate and talk because there is a lot of
misinformation.

Deputy Superintendent Rivera presented the Governor's 2023-24 proposed State Budget. Some questions were answered.
Information: B. FACILITIES: VILLA PARK HIGH SCHOOL POOL UPDATE
Public Comments:
John Kulisich; John Carcich: OUSD parent; Kristin Lambert: Villa Park HS needs a new pool.
Darshan Smalaaden: OUSD parent, the email that went out from ORCA to the community about the elections is unethical.
Erica Williams: Canyon HS is also dealing with pool problems. Don't put the VPHS pool in place of elementary school needs or Canyon HS
pool updates. Decide with integrity.
Deputy Superintendent Dave Rivera and Senior Executive Director of Administrative Services Scott Harvey presented the item. Some
questions were answered.
There will be an inspection/analysis of the three high school pools, followed by estimates of repairs and renovations as well as an
estimate of replacement/relocation of the pools with the existing size, or upgrades to a 31-meter or a 51-meter pool.
Information: C. ACADEMIC AUDIT
Public comments:
Luis Norret: the lack of communication with schools about the audit shows a lack of trust in teachers. Laurie Kayler: commends the board
for willingness to look for basics of academics. Do what is in the best interest of students. Sabrina Benneville: hopes we all want what is
best for students: access and equal opportunity. What is the audit and what do we hope to accomplish by it? We need to find common
ground and work together. Soren Williams, OUSD parent: Why was Sora app taken away? Don't ban books because of a simple
miscategorization. The new board has no plan or direction. Crystal Tousignant, OUSD parent: We are not sure what happens in the audit.
The public doesn't know. We need transparency because secrecy is scary. A Townhall forum is suggested. Sapna Chopra: OUSD parent:
troubled by a series of events. There is no transparency, no discussion. So much damage has been done within a month. The actions of
the board are undermining students' education and academic process. Matt W: OUSD parent. Deeply concerned about OUSD. Thanks for
suspending the app. Bring on the audit. Arianna Abibi: This board does not listen to students. She is not proud of OUSD as she was last
year. Jon Sanks: OUSD parent: what are we talking about in this audit? The description is not sufficient. Nobody is hurt by reading a

book, even when you read an inappropriate book. Gregory Pleasants, OUSD parent: it's illegal to close the opening session. It's an
American Democratic value to give public comments.
There was a discussion about the item. It was decided to bring the item back in a future meeting.
