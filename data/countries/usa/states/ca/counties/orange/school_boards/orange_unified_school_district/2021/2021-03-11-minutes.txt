you to staff and their steadfast cooperation, for all they have done to help us open up our schools safely. Also, thank
you to the Board of Education for their support in getting us to where we are now. I feel so proud to work in Orange
Unified where everything we do is based on our values, as to what we do for students. Some good news to share!
