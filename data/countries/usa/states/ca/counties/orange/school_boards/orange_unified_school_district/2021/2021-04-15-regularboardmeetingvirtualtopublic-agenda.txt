Goals :

1.3 Focus Area

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Ellevation Education is the English Learner student tracking information and instructional design software utilized
specifically for English Learners. Ellevation allows districts to meet compliance requirements, and also provides instructional
achievement tracking for English Learners. One much-needed component of the Ellevation product is the usability to reclassify
and track the progress and status of current English Learners and the reclassified English Learner population. Reclassified
students must be tracked for four years, which creates a large amount of paper communication. Ellevation software stores all the
names of these students in their student database, and is able to send teachers electronic forms to complete for the
reclassification monitoring compliance. This is all done with a few clicks and stored electronically.
Ellevation syncs with the District's Aeries system, so that student information is retrieved easily. Ellevation can also be coded to
automatically reclassify students when provided the requirements. Currently, this is performed by hand by Language
Assessment Clerks. This product will allow the Language Assessment Center to move into the 21st Century via digital
automaticity. This annual renewal will include the basic CA Bundle, data and implementation services, and in-person
professional development. The term of this renewal is from April 2021 through March 2022.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Resolution No. 23-20-21 Graduation Requirements: Class of 2021
The regular requirements for graduation and granting of a diploma from the Orange Unified School District are set forth in Board
Policy 6146.1. The entire OUSD community has come together to meet the unprecedented challenges presented by the COVID19 pandemic and the measures necessary to halt its progression, yet those measures also present practical impacts upon the
normal progression of learning leading to completion of graduation requirements. Districtoutreach efforts and home visits have
shown that student access to learning has been impacted by internet connectivity, living in environments with multiple siblings
/families, responsibility for caring for siblings/elderly family members both physically and financially, and issues with social
emotional wellness. To mitigate against these impacts and foster our OUSD Core Values, the attached Resolution No. 23-20-21,
temporarily suspends the regular graduation requirements for the Class of 2021 by decreasing the number of elective
requirements from 80 credits to 50 credits, which is a cumulative total of 202.5 credits. This temporary reduction still surpasses
the minimum state requirement of 130 credits/13courses.
