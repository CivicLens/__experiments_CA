4. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Hansen congratulated staff and students on a great start of the school year. All executive directors and Dr.
Hansen were out on school sites on the first day of school to visit classes and to witness a very smooth opening. She
thanked everybody for their hard work to get all schools up and running. This year has been like no other with the
pandemic. She mentioned that we're back in face masks because of new California Department of Education Masking
Guidelines after a brief period of time with fewer restrictions. In November, the governor will analyze the mask mandate
again. We could see some changes along the way in the next couple of months since it's an ever-changing evolving
situation with our health directives. Orange Unified will continue to follow the state guidelines to ensure our staff and
students are safe.

A video was shown on Measure S High School Science Centers updates, narrated by Board Member Rick Ledesma and
filmed at El Modena High School. Mr. Ledesma is looking forward to all the grand openings of the Science Centers of
Canyon, El Modena and Villa Park High Schools in 2022.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Board President Kathy Moffat thanked Mr. Ledesma for taking the time filming the Measure S update. Mrs. Moffat also
congratulated students, teachers, staff and administrators for their hard work to a successful opening of the school year
and thanked everyone for their patience with the continued measures of safety that we need to observe. Mrs. Moffat
recognized and thanked staff for a wonderful program of professional development that was put together for teachers and
staff. When we prepare well, we will position ourselves into having a successful school year.
Another word of congratulations goes to the Orange Unified Summer School program. They addressed needs that were
very real and there is appreciation on the part of students and parents.
Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Board Member Ana Page welcomed students and families back. She's excited for the new school year. She thanked and
highlighted the Communications Team with all the messaging they did throughout the summer. They also did a great job
on the social media campaigns on the first day of school, and it was great to see how all the families celebrated this day.
Board Member Angie Rumsey talked about the Liberty and Justice for All Forum, put on by the Superintendent of Orange
County that was mentioned at the last board meeting. The Orange County Department of Education also put on a forum,
and Mrs. Rumsey shared some notes that she found informative: there were 5 speakers, and they did have a concern
about the model ethnic studies curriculum that was adopted by the state of California. There were convincing arguments
that the model curriculum is framed by Critical Race Theory. Critical Race Theory is a hot topic in our community and
country. They argued that the grouping of the races according to the level of their victimhood rather than seeing each
other as individuals is something that might come out in this model curriculum. Those that are against the current ethnic
studies model are not against teaching history as long as it's done at an appropriate age. The comment that stood
out was that if students know the political leanings of their educators, something is done wrong. As an educator who
teaches history, this resonated with her. She doesn't teach a homogeneous group of students with all the same ethnicity
background or political leaning. This made her think about how she teaches history to properly create a conducive
learning environment that includes lively discussions in which students feel empowered to speak without fear that they
might contradict their teachers beliefs is one of the most important things as we tackle this. She wants to encourage
parents to be informed and watch both videos of the forums, one that is for ethnic studies and one that provides reasons
against it. The videos can be found on the Orange County Department of Education (OCDE) website.
Board Vice President Andrea Yamasaki welcomed students and families back. She thanked the staff and Dr. Hansen for
setting up a successful first day of school. During the day she talked to board members throughout the states and to
people of the non-profits that she belongs to share what their districts are doing. She mentioned that Orange Unified is a
leader: we were opened up all year, we had all personal protective equipments (PPE) in place, we were able to get
technology in the hands of our students, and this year we were able to develop an independent study program in our
district while other districts are still putting it in place. She is proud that we are doing so much work and setting our kids
up to be successful. She wants to take the time to say thank you.
Information: D. State of the School Report
Presentation on overview of the Summer school program by Mrs. Green and Mr. Angel. A video was shown on Summer
School.
Board President Kathy Moffat thanked staff for setting up such a great program. We had over ten percent of our student
body participating.
Board member Angie Rumsey enjoyed the presentation and thanked the presenters for providing a fun, rigorous and low
technology program.
Board member Ana Page loved how the program intentionally not used screens since the previous school year was so
screen heavy. It's no surprise that learning through play and hands-on activities resulted in bridging the gaps in potential
learning loss. Her own kindergartner attended 2 weeks of summer school and was excited every day.
5. APPROVAL OF MINUTES

Board President Kathy Moffat refers to two of the comments that request for items to be put on the agenda. Dr. Hansen
explains the process. There are board bylaws, 9322, that outlines the process for a citizen to request a board item. If that
request in not timely in terms of the production of the agenda, it will not be placed on the agenda. There is also a
conversation on the subject matter jurisdiction of the school board. It is not an automatic, there is a process that can be
found on our website. The procedure to request the item needs to be followed. The request will be analyzed and staff will
make a recommendation as to when it would be placed on the agenda or wether it is within the subject
matter jurisdiction of the board.
