4. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
Superintendent Gonzalez stated that the 2023-2024 rankings of the best high schools by US News and World Report were released
revealing that Canyon, El Modena, and Villa Park High Schools have maintained their impressive national metro area standing for the
fourth consecutive year. The three high schools secured positions in the top 25 percent or higher nationally. This is a testament to the
ongoing commitment and dedication of Orange Unified staff as well as partnerships with families and communities to fulfill Orange

Unfied's mission to provide a safe, equitable, and innovative culture of learning. Mr. Gonzalez also mentioned that student board members
are present tonight and he requested that order be maintained and directions of staff to be followed.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Board President Ledesma mentioned the house rules such as videotaping can only be done from a chair, disruptive audience members will
get a warning and will be removed after a second warning. He asked to be respectful to every speaker. Mr. Ledesma also mentioned that
the signature gatherers are spreading lies about him in the community and he wanted to set the record straight.
Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Trustee Miner shared that she met with parents about starting a math task force. She's excited to get math back on the right track. She
met with Mr. Jones, principal at Cerro Villa who is working hard on improving the campus as well as improving communications to the
families with a newsletter. Ms. Miner mentioned that she partnered with OC Supervisor Donald Wagner, OC Sheriffs, the OC Health
Agency, OC Fire Authority, and Villa Park City Councilwoman Crystal Miles to bring a Fentanyl town hall to Villa Park High School on
September 21st.
Trustee Erickson welcomed to Student Board Members and she mentioned that she's excited to get to know them and hear from them.
Ms. Erickson questioned why the Orange Unfied seal is on the Fenthanyl Town Hall flyer when it is not an Orange Unfied event. Legal
counsel Mr. Covert stated that some public agencies have prescriptive procedures that prohibit an individual who is a member of the board
team from using a real but there is no such prescription at Orange Unified. Currently, any trustee has the right to use the seal when they
send out communications regarding their role as a board member in the community.
Trustee Yamasaki attended the Nohl Canyon Patriots Day assembly this week and appreciated the acknowledgment of the families who
served during 9/11. She thanked the new principal Mr. Strickland for continuing the tradition.
Trustee Page enjoyed the back-to-school nights and noticed that all teachers were proud to share their classrooms. She encouraged the
community to become members of the PTA regardless of whether they have a student attending the school.

Acting Assistant Superintendent Human Resources Ms. Tracy Knibb presented the item.
This month Duyen Dao, a Teacher at Cerro Villa Middle School, and Yolanda Rodriguez, a School/Community Assistant at California
Elementary School were recognized. Acting Principal Jeff Jones had this to say about Duyen Dao: "Ms. Dao demonstrated the core values
by co-leading Cerro Villa's leadership class during the registration process and first-day activities for all of the student body. Ms. Dao led
with excitement, organization, and passion for CV which allowed her students to take ownership in providing a welcoming environment.
Ms. Dao has also continued to provide a positive learning environment for all our students with her leadership of lunchtime activities. Mr.
Jones appreciates the work and effort Ms. Dao has put into her leadership class and the positive impact she has had on the culture of CV.”
Principal Misty Brunasso had this to say about Yolanda Rodriguez: “Yolanda brings strong assets to her role and our school community is
incredibly fortunate to have her for support. She always goes above and beyond the call of duty to pursue excellence. For example, in
supporting our students she has helped parents complete over 100 free uniform applications, recruited families as GRIP mentors, and
creatively supported the growth of parent involvement. Yolanda easily develops and fosters relationships with faculty, students, parents,
and our guests. She is motivated and positively engaged, serving as a true inspiration.”

Action: F. PROPOSED REVISIONS TO BOARD POLICIES AND BYLAWS SECOND READING AND APPROVAL
Public comments:
Jolin Lang, OUSD parent: Meeting conduct and updates. Names should not be collected when attending a meeting. Policies allow people to
be removed. One person should have been removed immediately during the altercation earlier. Instead, a whole group participated and
should have been removed. We have good policies and we should follow them so board members don't have to leave, and student board
members don't have to be evacuated by staff. Meetings should be a safe and welcoming place for students, parents, and community
members.
Board President Ledesma commented on page 4 of Board Policy 9323: "The Board may order the room cleared if necessary. In this case,
members of the media not participating in the disturbance shall be allowed to remain, and individuals not participating in such disturbance
may be allowed to remain at the discretion of the Board. When the room is ordered cleared due to a disturbance, further Board
proceedings shall concern only matters appearing on the agenda. When disruptive conduct occurs, the Board may decide to recess the
meeting to help restore order, or if removing the disruptive individual(s) is not infeasible, move the meeting to another location". Mr.
Ledesma suggested three changes in the language: "The Board President may order the room cleared if necessary. In this case, members
of the media not participating in the disturbance shall be allowed to remain, and individuals not participating in such disturbance may be
allowed to remain at the discretion of the Board President. When the room is ordered cleared due to a disturbance, further Board
proceedings shall concern only matters appearing on the agenda. When disruptive conduct occurs, the Board President may decide to
recess the meeting to help restore order, or if removing the disruptive individual(s) is not infeasible, move the meeting to another
location". These changes are approved subject to the review and confirmation from the Superintendent and legal counsel that the
language is consistent with the Brown Act and the Government Code.
It is recommended that the Board of Education receive the proposed Board Policy revision for a second reading and approval with the
approval of amendments to BB 9323 pending research by the Superintendent and Legal Counsel.

15. CONSENT ITEMS - BOARD OF EDUCATION / SUPERINTENDENT
16. PULLED ITEMS FOR ACTION/CONSIDERATION
Action: A. Agenda Items pulled for Consideration/Action
17. PUBLIC COMMENT
Jolin Lang, OUSD Parent: There is a misconception that without the policy students are encouraged to lie to parents. Teachers will
encourage students to talk to their parents. Now teachers have to diagnose a student too. Schools missed PE. She volunteered last week
and it was chaotic.
Joette: Thanked the board for passing the policy. It shouldn't even have to come up. Kids are our kids. Parental rights should be an
established given.
Florita: Thanked the board for passing the policy. She wants to include de-transitioning in sexual education. The current curriculum is onesided. Include peer pressure as well. List resources for students to reach out to if they feel peer pressure.
Luise Salomon: Freedom fighter. The board has set a precedent. Wants to take California back. This is the beginning of something
amazing. Parents have jurisdiction over their kids.
Britt: How are we going to protect our children in bathrooms? We need a policy for that. Recall people are not telling the truth. That's not
good for the community.
