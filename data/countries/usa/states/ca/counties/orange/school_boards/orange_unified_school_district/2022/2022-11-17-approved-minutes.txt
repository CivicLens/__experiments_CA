Board President
Yamasaki
and Trustee
Moffat Report
attended the opening ceremony of the Orange Field of Valor. The choir of
Orange High School sang at the ceremony. Our elementary schools went on field trips, and many of our students
volunteered at the Field of Valor. Mrs. Yamasaki and Mrs. Moffat attended the 247th US Marine Corps birthday celebration
with the Orange High School JROTC. She also attended the Nohl Canyon jogathon. The event was a huge success. Along
with principals, directors, and teachers, Trustees Yamasaki and Erickson helped out at the Orange Unified Treats in the
Streets booth, an annual Halloween event in the City of Orange. She also visited Portola Middle School twice for various
events.
Information, Reports: D. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Trustee Erickson congratulated Portola Prep on hosting a wonderful cultural event for the celebration of Dia de Los
Muertos. Students participated in a variety of activities and contributed to the Ofrenda. Las Estrellas Ballet Folklorico
performed a variety of dances representing various states within Mexico. Dia de Los Muertos was also celebrated at the
Jordan Academy of Language and Computer Science. The rain did not stop the students from singing songs in Spanish
and listening to Aztec storytellers who also performed traditional dances. Trustee Erickson also had the pleasure of
attending McPherson Magnet School’s 1st-grade performance of Character Matters, a musical told from the perspective of
various fairy tale characters who met in a town forum to solve problems. They learned and sang about things like not
eating red riding hoods grandma, not judging a book by its cover, being a good friend, and the importance of good
character traits like honesty, generosity, and patience. Mrs. Erickson mentioned that the day before the board meeting
was International Day of Tolerance. She read the Declaration of Principles of Tolerance from the United Nations.
Trustee Moffat mentioned that the Elk's Lodge event to celebrate the US Marine Corps' birthday was wonderful. She's
proud to have the JROTC program at Orange Unified.
Trustee Page visited Esplanade Elementary. Students gave her a tour and truly showed they were proud of their school.
They also showed her the indoor pumpkin patch that was created to give every student an opportunity to visit a pumpkin
patch.
Student Board Member Ruby Hewitt gave a shout-out to the cheer team. They have a showcase at the time of the board
meeting and wished them good luck going into their season. This week is gratitude week at school with a different
activity every day. She also mentioned the VAPA Showcase in the Nature Center which is always a great day. She thanked
Student Board Member Diego Paz for taking the lead in giving Orange Unified the opportunity to participate in the City
Council meetings. They both presented at the City Council meeting as the new student liaisons.
Student Board Member Diego Paz also mentioned the first City Council Meeting. He could tell the Board was very
appreciative of their report. Diego also highlighted the Orange High School JROTC program. This group is very involved in
the community. They helped at the Field of Valor, they supported a lot of Veteran Day events, and of course, they
participated in the US Marine Corps birthday. He thanked the staff of the program for their support of the students. Diego
wished the Orange High Football team good luck in their CIF semi-finals. He also mentioned that for the first time in
school history, both the Cross Country girls' and boys' teams made it to CIF. Diego talked about the Simons STEM
Scholars Program, a collaboration with Chapman University. Representatives from Chapman University choose juniors for
a full-ride scholarship to the university. Diego is one of the recipients.
Student Board Member Madison Salloum shared that all fall sports came to an end except for Cross Country. They
made it to CIF and still have to compete. She's proud of the football team for having one of the best seasons ever. The
student section won Student Section of the Week which shows the great school spirit on campus. Also, the canned food
drive was a big success.
Student Board Member Hope Kimera mentioned 11 Villa Park athletes participated in the National Signing Day. Football
did well considering a big part of the team graduated last year and having a lot of new coaches. Hope is convinced
basketball will have a great year.
Trustee Yamasaki mentioned the GOCAT gala where a lot of our Orange Unified students performed.
Information: E. Board Recognition – “YOU'VE GOT THE EDGE” – Employee Of The Month Recognition Program
Superintendent Dr. Hansen introduced Dana Lusiani, School Nurse from Health Services/El Modena High School, and
Joseph Conway, Warehouse Worker/Delivery Driver from Nutrition Services who are the recipients of the "You've got
the EDGE" - Employee of the Month Award for the month of November. Board President Yamasaki read what El Modena
Principal, Sandra Preciado had to say about Dana: Dana Lusiani represents the OUSD’s core values of Integrity, Respect,
and Excellence. Her dedication to the wellness of our students is commendable as she strives to provide them with the
highest level of care. Dana and I recently responded to an emergency situation together where she embodied true
professionalism as a school nurse and took heroic actions to administer emergency, life-saving care in a highly stressful
situation. That day I was beyond thankful for Dana and her actions, but, in fact, we are all thankful every day for her
commitment and support. Thank you, Dana, for all you do for El Modena’s staff and students! Student and Community
Services Executive Director, Heriberto Angel, had this to say about Dana: Dana Lusiani exemplifies our OSD core values
as an integral member of our school nurse team. Dana takes great pride in her work serving the students of the District
and working collaboratively with the team to maximize our school health services. Her efforts are reflective of the school
nurse profession as a whole and her dedication is shown in the outstanding care provided to our students. The Student
and Community Services team is grateful for Dana’s contributions and commitment to excellence!
The second recipient for the evening is Joseph Conway. Nutrition Services Director, Jamie Sanchez had this to say about
Joseph: Joseph Conway exemplifies OUSD’s core values of respect and excellence. He is dedicated to providing excellent
customer service to the schools where he delivers food and is always willing to jump in and assist his colleagues and the
department whenever help is needed. Joseph keeps the genuine wellness and safety of all OUSD students at the heart of

everything he does. Not only does he take the time to smile and acknowledge students and faculty while making his daily
deliveries; he goes above and beyond by participating in school fundraising activities, and by taking a moment to shoot a
few hoops with kids on the basketball court. His actions not only brighten our students’ day, but also contribute to a
positive school culture where our students feel seen, heard, and valued. Nutrition Services is grateful for Joseph’s hard
work, dedication, and student-centered approach to excellence. California Elementary Principal, Misty Brunasso had this
to say about Joseph: Joseph Conway exhibits Respect in all things that he does. He greets our students with a smile, he
patiently waits for traffic to move and for the few minutes he is at California each day he is an integral part of our staff.
Even at six o’clock in the morning, he has a warm greeting for everyone he encounters! We recently did a fundraiser and
he went out of his way to participate and engage with our students/staff. He is essential in building community with the
way he treats our students. We are fortunate to have Joseph as a part of our California Bear family!
The Board of Education thanked Dana and Joseph for their dedication and devotion to the Orange Unified School District.
