Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Effective 2014-15, Education Code section 52062(b)(2) requires the school district governing board adopt its
budget at a public meeting. This meeting shall be held after, but not on the same day as, the public meeting at which the
governing board holds the required public hearing. The adoption of the proposed budget is scheduled for the June 3, 2021,
board meeting.
Average Daily Attendance:The 2021-22Budget is constructed on the following student population:
ADA
OUSD

22,906.65

Non-Public Schools
Community Day School
SB 1446 declining enrollment protection
County Special Education
County Community Schools
Sub-Total
El Rancho Charter MS
Santiago Charter MS

801.01
10.68
105.42
23,887.11
1,068.20
981.80

Orange County Classical Academy
391.91
Sub Total (Charter Schools Only)
2,441.91
GRAND TOTAL
26,329.02
The total budgeted attendance of 22,970.00(not including District charter schools, county special education, county community
schools, and SB1446 declining enrollment protection) reflects an anticipated decline of 346.11in District ADA. District charter
schools ADA of 2,441.91reflects a decline of 37.17as compared to the prior year.
Revenues:The following chart shows the driving factors of the LCFF in addition to ADA:
Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)

3.84%

Transitional Gap Funding

100.00%

3 Year Rolling Unduplicated English Learner (EL), Free/ Reduced (F/R) and Foster Youth (FY)
Student Percentage

49.32%

Until the state adopts its 2021-22Budget, the proposed funded LCFF yields an estimated $7,845,703increase as compared to
the prior year primarily due to the COLA.
Most state categorical entitlements and grants known to be ongoing are projected at current levels. Only special education
AB602 funding is expected to receive the 1.5% COLA. No increase is anticipated for ongoing federal programs in this adoption.
Interest earnings are projected at .75% and the lottery is estimated at $199per student ($150unrestricted, $49restricted by
Proposition 20).

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and the Local Control and Accountability Plan
(LCAP) regulations require that each districts LCAP public hearing be held in advance and at a separate meeting prior to the
LCAP adoption. The intent of the LCAP hearing is to allow for public comment and recommendations regarding the specific
actions and expenditures proposed to be included in the LCAP and budget (Education Code 52062(b)). Further, the regulations
require that the public hearing for budget be held at the same meeting as the public hearing for the LCAP.
For this year there are four distinct elements to the LCAP. The Annual Update for 2019-2020, 2021-2024 LCAPPlan Template,
Expenditure Tables and Budget Overview for Parents.These four major documents stand-alone in format, but are interconnected
in the actual LCAP process. In addition, the 2021-2024 Local Control and Accountability Plan is aligned to the EDGE, Orange
UnifiedBoard of Education's Strategic plan for 2019-2025.

In the preparation of the LCAP, there are eight state priorities that must be addressed in the Districts LCAP:
Conditions for Learning
Basic Services:provide all students access to fully credentialed teachers, instructional materials that align with state
standards, and safe facilities
Implementation of State Standards:implement the States Academic and Performance Standards in English and
English Language Development, Mathematics and the Next Generation Science Standards
Course Access:ensure all students have access to a broad course of study to prepare them for college and careers
Pupil Outcomes
Student Achievement:improved student learning for all students and subgroups measured by local assessments, state
assessments, English proficiency rates, and college and career readiness indicators
Other Student Outcomes: measuring other important student outcomes such as Career Technical Education (CTE)
pathway completion, A-G Course completion, Advanced Placement Completion and other locally identified
successmeasures
Engagement
Parental Involvement:meaningful participation by parents that include decision-making and program development
Student Engagement:supporting students connectedness and engagement in school including improved attendance
and graduation rates
School Climate:provide a welcoming, healthy school culture for all students as measured by engagement surveys and
district discipline data
The development and adoption of the LCAPis aState-mandated strategic planning process for districts across the State of
California.Actions and services identified in the eight state priorities are directly aligned to LCFF funding.
The Board of Education has received information on the LCAP Development Process, LCAP Annual Update and 2021-2024
Year OneLCAP goals and services, as well as the Districts summary of stakeholder engagement in Weekly Updates to the
Board.
The contents of the LCAP has been shared with the Superintendents District Advisory Council (DAC), District English Learner
Advisory Committee (DELAC), and various stakeholder committees. An intensive community engagement process beginning in
January2021resulted in continuous refinement of the LCAP actions and services through use of surveys, stakeholder input
meetings, and consultation with the employee associations.
The publication notification for the 2021-2024Year One Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) public hearing was placed
in the Orange County Register.The LCAP and budget document is available for public inspection at the District Administrative
Offices.
It is recommended that the Board of Education hold a public hearing and receive public comment on the 2021-2024Year One

1.1 Focus Area

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Education Code Section 37220 provides that Lincoln Day is to be observed on the Monday or Friday of the week
in which February 12 occurs and that Washington Day is to be observed on the third Monday in February. The parameters used
for Board approved student calendars in the Orange Unified School District provide that Lincoln Day be observed on the Friday
of the week before the observance of Washington Day."The Friday of the week before the observance of Washington Day
usually falls within the dates provided for Lincoln Day in Education Code Section 37220, except for in years where the
observance of Washington Day" falls on February 21. In situations like the one described here, Education Code Section 37220
allows the Board of Education to adopt a resolution to revise the observance dates of any of the holidays identified in this Section
except for Veterans Day. Because the observance of Washington Day falls on February 21, 2022, this item is to establish Friday,
February 18, 2022, as the observation date for Lincoln Day during the 2021-2022 school year, and is also to extend this practice
to future years where the observance of Washington Day falls on February 21.
