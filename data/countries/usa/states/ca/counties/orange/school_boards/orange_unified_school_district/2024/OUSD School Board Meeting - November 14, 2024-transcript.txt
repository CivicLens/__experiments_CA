02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:28.000]   So if the sale to a public agency does not occur for whatever reason, either because no public agency's expressed interest, a negotiation occurred, and a sale or long-term lease process could not be consummated, then the property can be put for formal bidding procedures.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:40.000]   So formal bidding entails what you see there in some detail, where the board would adopt a resolution of intent to engage in a formal bidding process.
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:48.000]   Actually, during a board meeting, the board would receive written bids and can also receive oral bids.
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:56.000]   And then the terms and conditions of the sale or lease must be identified in the initial resolution of intention.
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:02.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:16.000]   And then the board can select the highest bid and does not have to select the highest bid, but it is an opportunity for a formal bidding procedure for that property.
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:22.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:26.000]   Are you taking questions now or should we wait till the end?
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000]   I can take questions as we go along.
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000]   I have a question about that.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:41.000]   Is there a particular order that needs to be accounted for, or does everybody just put in their bid and whoever is the highest?
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:48.000]   Do we have any obligation to go to, say, a school first?
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:54.000]   Because there is the public offering process, that's almost part two of the surfacing process.
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:51:04.000]   So I think as we laid out, the board would approve a resolution dealing the property surplus, public agencies get the right of first refusal, and then there's a formal bidding procedure.
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:14.000]   During the formal bidding process and open session, no, there isn't, within that context, again, a right of first refusal to public agencies, if that's the question.
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:31.000]   Okay, and then so if a public agency is interested in the property and they want to use it, do they have the, is it restricted to what they can use it for, or say, if the city wanted to purchase something and then they wanted to find a private buyer?
[02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:34.000]   Is that something they can do?
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:46.000]   It's difficult to place restrictions like that on a buyer, but I think when it's another public agency, that discussion can happen pretty openly and transparently.
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:52:02.000]   There are certain ways that the district can navigate that, like, for example, within the deed itself, transferring the property, if it's a sale, certain conditions can be listed for the potential use of the property, and there are different options for navigating that.
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:11.000]   So if the district wanted to explore ways to maybe condition what the use would be after it's sold, that's something that can be discussed, yes.
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:32.000]   My concern is, okay, say someone makes an offer on it and it's below market, like, normally what we get if you put it out for private sale, and then they buy it at a lower price, thinking it's going to go to sort of the public and then they sell it to private for hire, and then they are making the difference.
[02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:35.000]   So, otherwise, we could have just sold it ourselves.
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:40.000]   Okay.
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:43.000]   Thank you for your question.
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:53.000]   I answered it.
[02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:56.000]   I have a question.
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:04.000]   I'm assuming other like cities municipalities have similar rules, right? They still have to make public offerings and things like that.
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:12.000]   Right. So, in terms of they can't just turn around and sell it to a private buyer, they would still have some of the same rules we would have as a public agent.
[02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:17.000]   They were typically cities and counties have to adhere to what we call the surplus land act.
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:30.000]   K-12s, like yourself, have their own surplus statutes that they follow, which we're canned in hand with the surplus land act, but cities and counties follow the surplus land act.
[02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:39.000]   So, there's their ordering is a little bit different as to the public offering process. But yes, generally, they do have to go through a similar procedure.
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:55.000]   Okay. Also, I have questions if you could explain a little bit more about the nailer act and exactly what that means. Is that specific to a municipality or and do they have to purchase it for that purpose?
[02:53:55.000 --> 02:54:12.000]   The school district's property that's under the 711 committee's review and has been recommended for surplus and surplus was used for recreational purposes for the immediate eight years prior to when it was surplus.
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:30.000]   And there is no other public agency or public facility within the vicinity that can make up the difference for the recreational area. That's, that's being lost. If this property is sold for non recreational purposes, then it meets the conditions of the nailer act.
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:41.000]   And under the nailer act, when it's offered to recreational agencies under the right of right of first refusal requirement, they can purchase it for less than fair market value.
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:56.000]   But that's actually a really good segue into this next slide. So, if I can, sure, because I had a question then is that if it's so like these fields that we have out here, they're used for baseball soccer or whatever.
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:08.000]   Is that what you're talking about? But if we have a playground, let's say we have a field on a school, but it's not being used by the public. It's just basically spare land that we have.
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:17.000]   Does that have to go to a city or recreational use first? Is that, is there a right of first refusal, even if it's not being used by the public?
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:28.000]   Yes, if it's, if it's been, if it meets those three criteria that I just mentioned, that it's recreational facilities that's been used that way for the prior eight years.
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:37.000]   And also that there's no public property within the vicinity that can make up for the space that's being lost.
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000]   Used by who for the prior eight years? That's my question.
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000]   Used by the school district.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:42.000]   By the school district.
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:46.000]   Okay, thank you.
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:58.000]   Why I said that was a good segue into the next slide is because there is an opportunity for school districts to seek waivers of the surplus procedures we just covered.
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:02.000]   The public offering and public bidding procedures.
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:14.000]   The district can make an application to the state board of education ask for either both to be waived or just the formal bidding procedures to be waived depending on what the circumstances are.
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:28.000]   And more and more these days we are seeing that school districts are asking for that flexibility from the state because you'll see in the second bullet that what that allows is that not that somehow there isn't going to be transparency around the sale or long term lease.
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:41.000]   What it allows the district to do is that either put it on the open market through an RFP process, or if the district so chooses to use potentially use a brokerage firm to do that.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:57.000]   There are options just like if a private individual was looking to potentially sell or long term lease their property, it would give the district options to do that through a more open market process as opposed to the more strict formal bidding procedures that we covered earlier.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:19.000]   So moving on to part two of the presentation which is alternatives to surplus and this is primarily how districts would procure short term or long term leases under the education code and government code sections that we're going to cover.
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:32.000]   For shorter term leases under the joint use statutes what we have identified there is education code section 17527 at SAC.
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:46.000]   The district can lease to on a short term basis to what you see there listed as including nonprofit institutions, private agencies, businesses under certain conditions.
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:52.000]   There is a five year term limit for this type of procurement of leases.
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:58:05.000]   There is an exception to that if the property is being leased to for park and recreational purposes by public entity or nonprofit corporation.
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:15.000]   A unique feature of this particular set of statutes is that the district must lease for fair market value.
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:23.000]   So there's a fair market rent component that is negotiated as part of this process. There is an exception for public entities.
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:32.000]   So for public entities that can be negotiated down and of course there would be a process for that again on the transparency front.
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:42.000]   The school board would have to approve a short term lease under the joint use statutes and make the three findings that you see listed there to at the bottom of the slide.
[02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:54.000]   So the school board would have to find and of course would have to be given sufficient information to be able to find that the use does not interfere with educational programs or activities of any school or class.
[02:58:54.000 --> 02:59:03.000]   Does not unduly disrupt the residents of the neighborhood and does not jeopardize the safety of children in the school.
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:14.000]   Are there any questions on this particular slide before I move to the next one.
[02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:29.000]   We did cover that the district can procure long term leases for up to 99 years after a property is deemed surplus. There are alternatives to that how where the district can again procure a long term lease for up to 99 years.
[02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:42.000]   And that's under the joint occupancy statutes education code 17515. This is the equivalent of being able to do a public private partnership with school district property.
[02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:51.000]   And again there is a very transparent process that that is engaged in in order to procure a long term lease of this type.
[02:59:51.000 --> 03:00:07.000]   As an initial step the board would have to approve what's called a resolution of intention where the board puts the community the world on notice that it's going to seek proposals for the development of district property.
[03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:26.000]   And also express in that resolution that what the procedure would be for that which is at a subsequent board meeting proposals would be received and considered by the board and the board has the option then of selecting the proposal that best meets the needs of the district.
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:44.000]   What is unique about this particular procurement method is that it does require that the district maintain a presence on the site. And what that means is that the district can require as part of the overall project that development be include a community good aspect.
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:01:02.000]   So that can be the equivalent we've seen of child development centers for example refurbishment of property or buildings that are on the site. So if for example the district needed updated adult ed classrooms or meeting rooms or in some cases.
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:20.000]   Additional recreational facilities those can all be part of parcel of the proposal that's put out and the developer would have to respond with how they will satisfy the requirements and the needs of the district.
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:37.000]   If there are no questions on the slide I will look to the next one. Another public private partnership series of statutes and procurement opportunity is under government code section 5956 at SEC.
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:48.000]   And you see here that the district may solicit proposals and enter into agreements with private entities for design construction or reconstruction of certain types of key producing infrastructure.
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:02:04.000]   So this typically would relate to it for example the district has cell tower leases, or in some cases what we're seeing in order to generate long term revenue streams districts are considering billboards that face the highways.
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:11.000]   So not facing the school side and not and typically on administrative facilities and not on school sites.
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:16.000]   But that is something just as an alternative outside the box opportunity that districts are considering.
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:25.000]   And the reason why this particular set of statutes are used to procure those leases is because it gives you a maximum term of up to 35 years.
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:40.000]   Which as you can imagine if you're for example building a billboard as a billboard company you'd want to have a longer lease term in order to get the benefit of the improvement that you're building and to be able to be on that site for some time.
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:47.000]   And then of course the district gets the benefit of a long term revenue generation opportunity.
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:03:02.000]   An important aspect of this and again speaking to the transparency of it, it does have some stringent auditing provisions that the district can require of the lessee.
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:18.000]   What we're seeing more and more from 711 committees as recommendations is also district please explore the opportunity to work with your sister public agencies so counties and cities to find ways to maybe do a joint development.
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:32.000]   So under the Community Recreation Act there is an opportunity to do that and so we wanted to include it. It authorizes and empowers cities and public school districts to cooperate to build joint recreational facilities.
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:50.000]   So it is a really good set of statutes to consider and when 711 committees make that type of recommendation we want to be able to give them the option how can that actually be developed and delivered pursuant to their recommendation.
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:04:04.000]   Question about that for Community Recreation, would say a pool qualify for that under that area? Yes. Okay.
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:08.000]   And we can have performing arts centers. That would be my next one.
[03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:22.000]   It's a somewhat broad definition of recreational under the statute so it's helpful.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:38.000]   I'm just touching on the last alternative to the surplus property procedures are the exchange procedures. So here a school district can exchange its property for the property of another entity that's interested in doing a potential exchange.
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:54.000]   Of course just like any sale of property, the district would want to do its due diligence, make sure that the property it's exchanging into is that it's explored of course all the title conditions around that property, the value.
[03:04:54.000 --> 03:05:07.000]   It does not have to be an even exchange in terms of value. The properties can be of an uneven value and the difference can be made up with an additional payment depending on what the difference is.
[03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:16.000]   And importantly, it does require two thirds vote to adopt a resolution that would allow for the exchange to occur.
[03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:29.000]   And just wanted to touch on that is again just an alternative to the surplus procedures.
[03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:40.000]   There's one more slide.
[03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:52.000]   So we do get the question a lot of of course, after surplus procedure and the steps that we've talked through throughout this presentation, what happens with lease and sale proceeds.
[03:05:52.000 --> 03:06:01.000]   So lease proceeds just a straight lease and along the lines of some of the procurements, procurement statutes that we've discussed.
[03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:11.000]   The board has the most flexibility to direct how those can be used. So that typically means that the lease revenue would become general fund revenue.
[03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:14.000]   And again, the district has flexibility with that.
[03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:24.000]   Lease with option to purchase. So the funds from a lease with an option to purchase, which we don't see very much. It's very rare.
[03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:34.000]   Maybe deposited into a restricted fund for routine repair of district facilities and that's as defined by the state allocation board and for up to a five year period.
[03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:52.000]   And then of course, sale revenue after surplus property procedures engaged in shall be used for capital outlay or for costs of maintenance of school district property that the governing board of the school district determines will not recur within a five year period.
[03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:59.000]   So you can say that the sale revenue is probably the most restricted.
[03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:10.000]   And that is the end of the presentation of open it up for more questions.
[03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:21.000]   I have a quick question. You mentioned that the board. In order, in order to serve us property, you need a two third vote.
[03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:31.000]   But isn't that the case with almost everything on here, like, whether we want to lease it or don't we need to use it.
[03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:34.000]   So your board policies require that yes.
[03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:35.000]   Okay.
[03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:50.000]   So that's the lease that is beyond the four year period. Okay, four years and and and more, but not every procurement method we discussed here requires that as a final approval from the board.
[03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:56.000]   Okay, but at least definitely that in our situation in your district. Yes.
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000]   It's not like that in all districts.
[03:07:58.000 --> 03:07:59.000]   No.
[03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:06.000]   Thank you.
[03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:15.000]   Any additional questions.
[03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:32.000]   I mean, can you share some next steps with what happens after we pass the resolution and the bylaws? Yes, absolutely. So after the resolution, the bylaws are passed and we will be able to now move forward to form the 711 committee, we would move forward with the application process.
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:48.000]   We would bring forward the members that are identified and to make sure that they fit the seven criteria that are required to be part of the 711 committee. We would bring that forward and then the board would agree to those members being and then we would set meeting dates to start having that.
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:09:02.000]   That process start to take place. So, well, today we shared some steps after the 711 because we wanted to share with the board just some options in terms of recommendations that may come forward to you as part of that 711.
[03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:18.000]   We wanted to give that to you so that we also share with you with some of the information that we'll be sharing with that committee with the board's approval tonight and the resolution as well as the bylaws, we will move forward with the process of the application.
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:23.000]   Okay, so once we have the members, we'll probably get a presentation similar to this. We'll get trained.
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:30.000]   Correct. The members would be and we would bring those names to you before they are actually part of the committee.
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:42.000]   Could the presentation be modified so that we can add additional examples and hypotheticals like if there's parents serving on this committee, they would be able to understand it.
[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:54.000]   Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. And even when we go through the process, we would definitely have more visuals and more of a breakdown and that's tonight's presentation provided you a lot of information, more of a general overview.
[03:09:54.000 --> 03:10:04.000]   So we'll go through the different steps. We want to break it down to smaller chunks and we would obviously do that as well too with the 711 committee. Yes, absolutely.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:10.000]   All right, so I'll move it real quick before you go.
[03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:17.000]   One thing I would suggest to the board is really expanding what you're going to look at.
[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:23.000]   And that will provide you the opportunity for future use, regardless if you use it or not.
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:35.000]   For example, if you were to include here, whether or not you sell it, Lisa, do whatever, but at least you have that on the table instead of going back and forth and back and forth.
[03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:43.000]   That's been my experience that we've done this over the years that we just provided a bunch of different properties to look at.
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:52.000]   It's not to scare individuals to say that, oh, we're going to close your school and we're going to close this one. It's just providing options to consider.
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:11:02.000]   And that's, I believe, posed in that manner. It's providing those options to consider for the public to have knowledge of what that means.
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:12.000]   Because if you spend your wills, they're not that difficult. This makes it sound like it's earth-shattering, but it's actually a piece of cake.
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:30.000]   And you have the right people on there with the right knowledge and you leading the charge, this whole game, you know, will be amazing to guide them through this process because it's basically showing it to them, do we need it, do we not need it?
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:33.000]   And that is the simple answer.
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:44.000]   And so I would recommend to this board is you're going to hamstring yourself if you just singular and then you come back and redo it again, then you come back and redo it again.
[03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:54.000]   You're going to be on this process training forever versus getting out front and proposing a variety of different properties just so they're there on the books.
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:12:10.000]   And you're going to do what you do, but I'm just giving you that recommendation for past experiences and it streamlines it a lot faster in the event you do want to sell at a much more rapid pace or at least for that matter.
[03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:18.000]   It gives you a flexibility you want, the ultimate flexibility, instead of going back and forth and back and forth.
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:32.000]   Thank you, Mr. Taker for bringing that up because in the bylaws, it does allow the board to have that flexibility and while the resolution looks at the portion of the levita are bylaws, the bylaws in front of you do allow that flexibility and the amendment to be made to the
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:35.000]   resolution so thank you for putting that up.
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:53.000]   And then they can be made at any time or so tonight we adopt the resolution and it's only for the media. We can then amend that prior to the 711 meeting is that what you're saying we would, we could, it could be done at any time on the
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:13:04.000]   recommendation would be to first go through that process there but what I mean by that with the bylaws is that you can have those members also serve to look at other properties as well to that the district may be interested in.
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:18.000]   So if we, okay so this one specifically deals with levita we had previously talked about Taft as a, I think it was Taft, the field and Taft as a secondary.
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:22.000]   And those were the only two we were looking at right.
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:35.000]   Okay, I understand what Mr. Ortega is saying I also, since we've never done it we want to be a little cautious and make sure that we are doing things correctly and understanding exactly what we're doing.
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:41.000]   And I, but I appreciate that experience, but I wouldn't be.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:49.000]   I think we probably should go forward with Taft at some point.
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:14:03.000]   I just want to make it clear for the public surfacing a property your school does not made us to sell anything right.
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:04.000]   Correct.
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:06.000]   Not at this time.
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:17.000]   Right, because all of this was very overwhelming but just to be clear the surplus is the very first step to do any of these things unless we surplus.
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:28.000]   We can't do anything with it right now. Yes, it's putting the committee together to make some recommendations. And again, that committee does not find the board to do anything.
[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:37.000]   It's an advisory committee that will bring back recommendations to the board gives us then options to go forward so that we can best get the best value from our assets.
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:39.000]   Correct.
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:51.000]   Is there exploration as to surfacing once you surfaced the property it's forever surfaced or or can you pull it back or what's that process.
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:54.000]   It's not forever.
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:15:01.000]   Usually, as a best practice, the statute just don't have a specific timeframe around it.
[03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:13.000]   But for best practice, we'd say no, no longer than 10 years after surplus resolution has been approved. Do you want to rely on that? So we have properties that we've surfaced over 10 years ago.
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:16.000]   Do you recommend us for blessing it again?
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:21.000]   You may want to consider them again. Yeah.
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:37.000]   At least remind the community what the background was at the time that they were reviewed and the surplus determination was made just so that it's fresh and that the board and the community are receiving the information in real time and there's transparency around it.
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:42.000]   Okay, so recommend it 10 years.
[03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:55.000]   And there is a procedure for these surplus.
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:58.000]   Any additional comments?
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:02.000]   There are motions.
[03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:05.000]   I'll move it. Is there a second?
[03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:13.000]   Okay, motion carries 7-0.
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:18.000]   Thank you. Thank you.
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:22.000]   Moving on to information items.
[03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:29.000]   For post revisions to board policies and by law first reading.
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:35.000]   I'll take it.
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:43.000]   So the district's board policies and bylaws are reviewed and updated periodically as new state and federal laws and regulations are enacted.
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:54.000]   The proposed revisions for the following board policies are presented for first reading.
[03:16:54.000 --> 03:17:05.000]   So there's no action to be taken. We're just presenting them for first reading. But if anybody has any comments, we're happy to take them.
[03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:10.000]   Are there any comments right now?
[03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:16.000]   I was wondering if you're going to do what we did last time and do some assignments.
[03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:22.000]   We could assign. We'll split it up with between five board members.
[03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:29.000]   So maybe in the Friday packet, we'll send that out again.
[03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:39.000]   Thank you. So we'll go ahead and split that up evenly between the board members and the board members who will review all the board policies with those paid special attention to those that they're assigned.
[03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:47.000]   Thank you.
[03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:59.000]   Consent items. Consent items are acted upon by one motion. However, any such item can be considered separately out of board members are passing with acted upon by approval of the consent items.
[03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:04.000]   Are there any items to be pulled?
[03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:09.000]   None? Okay. Is there a motion to approve all consent items?
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:15.000]   I'll move it. Thank you, Trustee Erickson. Is there a second?
[03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:21.000]   Thank you, Trustee Pulley. Any discussion?
[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:23.000]   All in favor?
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:24.000]   Aye.
[03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:46.000]   We have four public comments. The first is Carlos Sanchez.
[03:18:46.000 --> 03:19:10.000]   Going once, going twice. Carlos Sanchez. Okay. Dr. Heather Chapman.
[03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:21.000]   Good evening, President Page, trustees, cabinet, and community. It's with great frustration and concern that I share the following information with you regarding the two-day power outage at El Medina High School.
[03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:36.000]   We found it unbelievable that after Southern California Edison sent notifications of potential two-day power outage to locations within the district, OUSD leadership did not create any plans for protecting safety and instructional time.
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:45.000]   When the power went off and then additional outages occurred due to wind damage, the district leadership took no action other than keeping students inside.
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:53.000]   No clear direction or communication was given for a potential second day of outages and staff was left to scramble.
[03:19:53.000 --> 03:20:11.000]   We received two contradictory messages within minutes on day two, then the plan was there is no plan. We are exceptionally concerned about functioning on a large campus with no power, no phones, no internet, no ventilation, and no public announcement system.
[03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:24.000]   Some classrooms had no windows and keeping the door open was not an option for most of the first part of the outage. Staff received no communication about who had radios or what to do in another emergency.
[03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:39.000]   Staff was expected to use personal cell phones for communication with no ability to charge those devices. No emergency phone numbers were distributed. Staff had no access to student emergency cards, custody information, or schedules.
[03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:53.000]   From the moment the outage began, we expected that the district office would shift into emergency mode as it does in other crises. But by the second day, we could not believe that we were still expected to complete our work on site.
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:21:08.000]   Employee associations reached out to the district leadership seeking solutions, such as taking the school day remote, whether synchronous or asynchronous, and we asked that we be communicating more clearly with staff and students caregivers.
[03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:17.000]   This was rejected. Experienced faculty and staff also suggested some classified staff could work from home or at other district locations.
[03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:28.000]   Our students who chose to attend school or who needed power or internet access could have been directed to other school sites, multi-purpose rooms, libraries, and district office spaces.
[03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:41.000]   All of those could have served as command centers. We implore district leadership to create and implement emergency plans for these types of events that will undoubtedly occur over and over again.
[03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:52.000]   These plans must include ideas for ongoing communication and access to vital information that is stored digitally. Staff and student safety was at risk.
[03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:59.000]   With the push to digital resources, many teachers found their options limited and instructional time was lost.
[03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:06.000]   To sum it up, these events are bigger than what site-based administration can be expected to navigate.
[03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:19.000]   I also would like to acknowledge the staff and students of Prospect and Esplanade elementary schools who were unnecessarily impacted and solidarity with the class of by-adenters and vacated workers at El Regina High School. Thank you.
[03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:34.000]   I believe Carlos Sanchez walked in and then walked out. Okay. Okay.
[03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:50.000]   Joel Linnling. You're good. Darshan Smallada.
[03:22:50.000 --> 03:23:01.000]   Good evening, board. I'm going to be very quick. President Page, Mr. Gonzalez, a couple of things to piggyback on what Dr. Chapman said.
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:10.000]   I actually live in the area that is on the same grid as the high school. This has happened to my house five times. This will happen again.
[03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:29.000]   All of the other outages, I believe, happened when school was not in session, so Thanksgiving break, times like that. So I implore the district leadership to come up with a temporary, if not perfect solution immediately so that we can, you know, while you're developing a better plan or more long-term plans.
[03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:51.000]   This is not something that's going to be ending soon. And yeah, bad situation. The other request that I have is that if we could please notify those people who applied to the 7-11 committee already, and there's a little bit of confusion amongst the general public about, oh, I already applied, I was accepted, and would be making the next round.
[03:23:51.000 --> 03:24:00.000]   So if we could reach out to those individuals, I would ask you to do that. That's it. Thank you.
[03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:12.000]   We'll give Carlos Sanchez one more chance if he's outside on the phone.
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:21.000]   Okay, that's it.
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:24.000]   Thank you for all the public comments.
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:34.000]   Mr. Gonzalez, can we get a report on what happened last week and a list of communications that happened in the time that they were sent out?
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:38.000]   Yes, we can. Thank you.
[03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:45.000]   So now on to 18A.
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:55.000]   Do we want to schedule our, try to schedule our second December meeting since we're going to have to have a second December meeting since we're here and then the public will be aware of it?
[03:24:55.000 --> 03:24:58.000]   Would that be something we should do or not?
[03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:01.000]   I mean, are we aware of when we're available in December?
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:09.000]   Yeah, that's what I'm asking. Should we try to see if we're able to do that now?
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:16.000]   Yeah, I mean, if you guys want to suggest some dates, if not, we can have Ms. Eric to talk to us with a couple dates.
[03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:20.000]   I think it's probably easier since we're all here.
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:31.000]   We will have other board numbers, though, that we'll need to weigh in with another audience. They probably don't need to participate in that right now, so maybe we can do that.
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:37.000]   We can propose a few days.
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:41.000]   How about let's start it down to two dates.
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:45.000]   Do you want to do it before, after the organizational meeting?
[03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:48.000]   I think we should do it after. Okay.
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:59.000]   And I'm thinking maybe the 18th, the Wednesday, which was just a couple days after.
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:05.000]   Okay, that's one option. Is there a second date?
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:07.000]   That works for me.
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:12.000]   And then that's also before school is out, so it won't be over winter break.
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:20.000]   Or are you doing Thursday the 19th to give them a couple of days in between?
[03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:27.000]   Okay, so the 18th of the 19th, we can have Ms. Eric look into the boardroom to see if it's available.
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:30.000]   And when we can all come in.
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:37.000]   And I'm sort of not really available on the 19th, but I can, I can change it if I have to.
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:42.000]   It's my anniversary dinner, but I can change it if I need to.
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:48.000]   My husband will understand, I'm sure.
[03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:54.000]   Oh, okay. Well, you trump me then.
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:27:05.000]   And is it going to be a regular board meeting or will it be a study session?
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:09.000]   Regular board meeting.
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:10.000]   Yes.
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:15.000]   I think it was just that we have another meeting because of the items that weren't discussed today.
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:20.000]   So we haven't developed the agenda toward the.
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:26.000]   16 completely, but we do have some requirements that we need to take care of the budget.
[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:34.000]   And of course, the organizational portion of that, but we can look at the other items and maybe make some suggestions as to what should be on each to make sure that.
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:38.000]   More balanced.
[03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:43.000]   But I would probably say to be on the safe side, we might want to.
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:49.000]   Consider that we could take some action on the 18th or 19th, if we need to.
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:54.000]   If there's minimum amount of items, you know, we could do both.
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:28:00.000]   My understanding was there could be some facilities issues that would take longer to discuss.
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:10.000]   Essentially, okay, so you need us to meet the week earlier.
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:18.000]   I think those dates will work percent.
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:29.000]   Okay, we'll schedule it as a regular board meeting just so that we have flexibility based on everything that we have on there, including swearing in 5, 4 numbers.
[03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:31.000]   All right.
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:42.000]   So, Christie is Ramsey and rotated. Can you please join me over at the podium.
[03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:47.000]   Trustee, I'm talking to do want to say some words now while we transition over.
[03:28:47.000 --> 03:29:05.000]   Well, I just wanted to thank them for their service and to our usd and to the kids and but I wish them both well and and whatever endeavors they do in the future and.
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:11.000]   Thank you.
[03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:15.000]   I guess we're just talking.
[03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:28.000]   Mr. Ramsey, it was a pleasure getting to know you over the last four years. Thank you very much for always being very cordial and play and participating and it's been, it's been very nice and miss.
[03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:32.000]   We appreciate your 22.
[03:29:32.000 --> 03:29:39.000]   Less years of service. So thank you.
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:48.000]   So before the district gives some recognition, we do have others who could not make it tonight. So we have.
[03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:53.000]   Super intended doctor bean who intended to join us to personally thank you.
[03:29:53.000 --> 03:30:01.000]   But was able to attend due to the agenda change. So he will be sending some certificates.
[03:30:01.000 --> 03:30:10.000]   And then additionally, we have the laparque councilman, miss crystal miles had planned to also present some certificates on behalf of this bill park city council.
[03:30:10.000 --> 03:30:13.000]   To both trustees or take it and Ramsey.
[03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:20.000]   Instead, we are presenting certificates on behalf of the laparque mayor, miss Rosini and.
[03:30:20.000 --> 03:30:27.000]   Councilwoman miss miles expressing the city's gratitude for their commitment and service.
[03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:54.000]   And then we also have certificates from assembly member of Lino Valencia in recognition of our trustees dedication.
[03:30:54.000 --> 03:31:20.000]   And then we also have certificates from the industry for all that they have done for our schools and community.
[03:31:20.000 --> 03:31:30.000]   Thank you to all the members of the board of education and our orange and white school district. We also want to thank you for your dedicated service to our district.
[03:31:30.000 --> 03:31:36.000]   Just be Ramsey we began our journey on the board together and it's been a pleasure working alongside you.
[03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:43.000]   And I especially enjoyed partnering with you to mentor our student board members and your guidance has been a lasting impact on them.
[03:31:43.000 --> 03:31:57.000]   It's been wonderful to witness. I appreciate your perspective on the board as an educator and your thoughtfulness and the heart that you put into supporting our school community is deeply appreciated.
[03:31:57.000 --> 03:32:14.000]   We do have one small gift.
[03:32:14.000 --> 03:32:27.000]   She has been who has made a lasting impact as the longest consecutively serving member of the orange school district's board of education.
[03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:34.000]   Your years of service have shown your commitment to our schools and community and the legacy of your work will be influenced.
[03:32:34.000 --> 03:32:49.000]   We'll influence OSC for years to come. Thank you John for your dedicated service to our students and families of OSC and we also have something for you.
[03:32:49.000 --> 03:33:02.000]   Congratulations.
[03:33:02.000 --> 03:33:26.000]   Thank you.
[03:33:26.000 --> 03:33:48.000]   First, I would like to extend my gratitude to Orange Unified District staff and my fellow trustees.
[03:33:48.000 --> 03:34:00.000]   Thank you for accepting me into this world, guiding me through the process of being a trustee and helping me to continue to learn, continue my learning as an educator.
[03:34:00.000 --> 03:34:10.000]   Secondly, I would like to thank the Orange Unified School community as a private school teacher. I appreciated the ability to see great teachers in action.
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:20.000]   I consider myself a lifelong learner and took advantage of an opportunity to learn from the great educators in this district.
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:30.000]   Clearly, OUSD's programs exhibit the foresees. Creativity, collaboration, critical thinking and communication.
[03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:39.000]   I would like to thank John Ortega, John has served the city and this district and this board for 20 years.
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:52.000]   We talked about, one time we talked about how my grandfather was a group of orange trees here in Orange and harvested oranges and his grandfather did the same.
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:58.000]   And so it's kind of neat to think that they may have been side by side harvesting oranges here.
[03:34:58.000 --> 03:35:11.000]   Trustee Ortega has demonstrated a commitment to this district to better our schools and has worked as an advocate for our students and their families.
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:21.000]   This time on the board has shown me the amazing programs and opportunities offered at every single school in this district.
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:30.000]   My prayers will continue to be with this board, the decisions they make and the students and families they serve. Thank you.
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:37.000]   [Applause]
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:49.000]   Good evening. People have asked, you know, how do you feel? What's it like? It's a very joyous occasion is what it is.
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:56.000]   Ms. Sarrick has asked me tonight, you know, how do you feel? What's going on? I said, it's no different.
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:36:06.000]   I dedicated my time to this district, to the students in the staff for a little over 23 years.
[03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:14.000]   When I first joined the board, I'd ask, what is the board? What do you do?
[03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:26.000]   It was a rather interesting time at the juncture. And so it's, I look at it as I put my heart and soul into it.
[03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:38.000]   My background hasn't served in law enforcement. Started my journey many years ago in law enforcement to serve and help others and help those that couldn't help themselves.
[03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:45.000]   To be their need, be there to support them in their needs or their circumstances.
[03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:55.000]   It taught me a lot to work with a variety of different individuals. And it didn't matter the circumstances, who they were, what they looked like.
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:37:03.000]   My parents always taught me how to respect everybody, regardless of who you are.
[03:37:03.000 --> 03:37:14.000]   You treat the same person as you would if you're the custodian or the CEO. It doesn't matter. You respect them equally.
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:26.000]   And so I would like to just give some comments that I'm not going to go into a long laundry list of things that we did here in this district.
[03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:41.000]   A lot of you do know that my faith is very serious to me and that's where I hold my grounding and why I do what I do for that reason.
[03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:54.000]   I took a little note and I said I began this journey 23 years ago and I want to express my deepest gratitude to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, as well as to my beautiful wife.
[03:37:54.000 --> 03:38:04.000]   Unfortunately, my family was not able to be here this evening due to some personal commitments that I can't speak of.
[03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:19.000]   My amazing children, very blessed to have great children, great heads on their shoulders, and they have all come through their system just like I have, that's why.
[03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:30.000]   And especially to my supportive parents, who my father is a graduate of one trade school, run in many, many years ago.
[03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:41.000]   But they have taught me an immense amount of everything for who I am today.
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:45.000]   Their love and encouragement have been my foundation throughout this journey.
[03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:54.000]   I am grateful to many individuals who have impacted my path over the years, especially those from whom I've had the privilege to learn.
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:39:05.000]   My heartfelt thanks also goes to the voters, the parents, the staff, and students for their confidence and trust in me all these years.
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:15.000]   I've had the opportunity to work alongside many superintendents, assistant superintendents, staff members.
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:19.000]   The list is very long.
[03:39:19.000 --> 03:39:29.000]   I've learned from all of them, and that's how and how it made me become the board member that I am, is to ask questions.
[03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:36.000]   Because as policy makers, that's our job, is to make policy but make good policy.
[03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:45.000]   So you have to ask what and how do I become effective in what I'm doing in this job.
[03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:54.000]   I was reminiscing about first coming on with Robert French. Some of you in the audience may have remembered him.
[03:39:54.000 --> 03:40:03.000]   And we actually became really close. He loved his cookies. He was a funny guy.
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:13.000]   And we'd all make friendly wagers in the sense when he came to football season because he was a huge USC fan. Huge.
[03:40:13.000 --> 03:40:21.000]   So we'd make friendly wagers so basically whoever lost had to wear the other teams gear.
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:29.000]   We decorated the dais in the other team. There were times where, believe it or not, I had to wear a USC gear.
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:35.000]   And it was fun times. And that's what made it so fun and interesting to serve on the board.
[03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:46.000]   And we learned a lot. You know, we had Tom Godley, we had Renee Dreyer, Michael Christensen,
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:41:06.000]   Brunner Hansen, Mr. Gonzalez. They're all great in their own unique ways and what they can attribute to this district and provide the leadership and guidance that's necessary.
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:18.000]   When I first arrived here on scene, there we go, talking cop talk. And our time together, we had the board navigated through, if you can imagine, multiple schedules.
[03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:32.000]   We had a multi-track, single-track and traditional track. So if you can imagine managing all of those tracks, it was a nightmare. But we got through it.
[03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:46.000]   And then we, I was told about how some schools were looked at and how they were treated and things like that. So we did a lot of curing immediately on that.
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:42:04.000]   And as an example, when the Williams settlement presented itself, we acted decisively and saw funding aggressively in allocated district savings to bring comprehensive updates to many of the schools, which I've spoken about in about seven of them.
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:24.000]   I will say Mr. Christensen, during his tenure as director of facilities in maintenance, he was aggressively acquiring that funding plus some of the savings that we had saved as well along the way to make that project happen for those seven schools.
[03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:29.000]   So we were pretty proactive on what we were trying to accomplish.
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:49.000]   The other education incentives are the early college academy, which if we go back even many years ago, and I share the story where we did the middle college academy, middle college school, and this didn't happen at that time.
[03:42:49.000 --> 03:43:08.000]   But now that we have the ECA is skyrocketing as well as all the other programs, the pathways that we have pathways are exciting for a lot of our students and they're all in different subjects.
[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:29.000]   And so these pathways empower them to enter workforce, pursue further educational confidence. Then I don't want to prolong it, but it's just there's so much and I want to share with the board, the new board members, your responsibility is going to be great.
[03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:45.000]   And listen to both sides, because you may be able to glean and believe her or not, I've gleaned from those who constantly love speaking about me.
[03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:58.000]   But as long as you can learn from that, garner some good ideas, things of that nature, some things that you may not think you're in favor of that you are in favor of.
[03:43:58.000 --> 03:44:04.000]   So I'm in it with an open mind.
[03:44:04.000 --> 03:44:16.000]   As I always say, don't do good deeds publicly to be admired by others, or you will lose the reward from your father and have him.
[03:44:16.000 --> 03:44:23.000]   So it's more important to do things in secret than public, is what that is.
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:39.000]   And we're entrusting you to continue with the fiscal responsibility that we have our financial reserves and everything associated with it.
[03:44:39.000 --> 03:45:01.000]   There's other things that I would like to speak of, but not at this juncture, and I just think for you to continue to look at our department maintenance, making sure it's online at 4%, which is equating to about 16 million a year to make sure that's in the budget.
[03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:09.000]   So again, I just want to say thank you again for enduring support and partnership. It has been my honor to serve this community.
[03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:29.000]   And as I said, I can be here all night thanking many, many, many individuals that I've worked with who are just awesome men and women who truly care for this district, care for the students, and truly want to be effective in what they do.
[03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:48.000]   And so I think you with that, what I would say is Ms. Ramsey stated, you know, I will continue to pray for you and this board and may God bless you.
[03:45:48.000 --> 03:45:51.000]   Thank you both for everything in your words.
[03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:59.000]   We do have some refreshments. So please stay to have a piece of cake and congratulate trustees or to get in them.
[03:45:59.000 --> 03:46:02.000]   And now we will adjourn the meeting.
[03:46:02.000 --> 03:46:20.000]   President Page, were you adjourned? I just wanted to make a clarification on the additional meeting that we're adding, although we don't have an official date yet, because it was an agenda to add that as a regular meeting, whether or not we do a study session or we have an agenda with action items and information.
[03:46:20.000 --> 03:46:22.000]   It is considered a special meeting.
[03:46:22.000 --> 03:46:24.000]   Okay, thank you for the clarification.
[03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:35.000]   President Page, I do have some interesting comments to make very briefly. First and foremost, my apologies, and I might have bled a little bit, so if my voice is a little bit grassy, it is because of that.
[03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:45.000]   First and foremost, I would like to thank Ms. Rotega for this 18 years of service and dedication to the betterment of education here in Georgia by the school districts.
[03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:59.000]   I was a graduate of Phillip Park High School. There's some commonality in the three months, and seriously, Ms. Rotega, you've been a role model to me on this board, and I'm sure you have been a role model to many of the trustees and student board members as well.
[03:46:59.000 --> 03:47:05.000]   Vice President Rumsey, I'd like to thank you for your service in this district as well as vice president.
[03:47:05.000 --> 03:47:18.000]   Working with her, with the student rights, I know for a fact or dedication, as a board trustee, as an educator, your attention, your attention to your students are well-attentioned and good.
[03:47:18.000 --> 03:47:24.000]   I'd just also like to speak to some of the tragedies that happened this morning.
[03:47:24.000 --> 03:47:43.000]   It happened at around 11 o'clock a.m., I believe, and the school went up and down, and it was definitely unnerving for myself and for many students at the high school, coming out of the class and seeing cop cars and yellow tape throughout the block.
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:54.000]   I'd like to offer my sincerest condolences to the friends and families of the individual who unfortunately passed away this morning.
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:48:03.000]   But I do believe that as Spartans, we are strong, we are resilient, and we are able to prevail from the tragedy that occurred this morning.
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:10.000]   I'd also like to thank Superintendent Gonzalez for his service and Superintendent of the Orange Unified School Districts.
[03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:21.000]   And as the first Hispanic, first official Hispanic Superintendent of the Orange Unified, you have some example of strong exemplary leadership for other superintendents in the future.
[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:26.000]   Thank you so much, and I'm very glad that she'll stick with us in the future as deputy superintendent.
[03:48:26.000 --> 03:48:37.000]   That's all I have to say. Thank you so much. How much do you want?
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:49:04.000]   We'll adjourn at 8.43.
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:14.000]   Thank you.
[03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:24.000]   Thank you.
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:34.000]   Thank you.
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:44.000]   Thank you.
