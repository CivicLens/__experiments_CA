that the teacher has received a specified level of training relative to the subject area to be taught, that the teacher consents to
the assignment, and that the local governing board takes action on the assignment. These assignment options are typically
employed in middle schools and high schools where the teacher is assigned to instruct groups of students in a specific subject
matter area or areas.

based upon authorized assignment options in the Education Code where the teacher has met all requirements and has

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover
assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact.

ADVANCED TOPICS IN CHINESE: LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
Students will grow their understanding of Chinese language and culture by applying the interpersonal, interpretive, and
presentational modes of communication in real-life situations as they explore concepts related to family and community, personal
and public identity, beauty and aesthetics, science and technology, contemporary life, and global challenges.
This course meets the UC F approval.
BIOTECHNOLOGY II (CTE)

Biotechnology II is a capstone course for the Biotechnology pathway that fuses academic and technical training to prepare
students to work in the growing biotechnology industry. Biotechnology II builds upon the content and skills acquired in
Biotechnology I. Students will explore advanced concepts and laboratory research techniques currently used in the field of
biotechnology. In addition, students develop the laboratory, critical thinking, and communication skills currently used in the
biotechnology industry. Furthermore, students will explore and evaluate career opportunities in the field of biotechnology through
extensive readings, laboratory experiments, class discussions, research projects, guest speakers, and workplace visits.
IB HISTORY HIGHER LEVEL 1
The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme (DP) History course is a world history course that involves the study of
a variety of types of history, including political, economic, social and cultural, and provides a balance of structure and flexibility.
The course emphasizes the importance of encouraging students to think historically and to develop historical skills as well as
gaining factual knowledge. It puts a premium on developing the skills of critical thinking, and on developing an understanding of
multiple interpretations of history. In this way, the course involves a challenging and demanding critical exploration of the past.
Teachers explicitly teach thinking and research skills such as comprehension, text analysis, transfer, and use of primary sources.
This course meets the UC A approval.
IB MATHEMATICS: ANALYSIS AND APPROACHES STANDARD LEVEL:
The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme (DP)Mathematics: Analysis and Approaches course recognizes the
need for analytical expertise in a world where innovation is increasingly dependent on a deep understanding of mathematics.
The focus is on developing important mathematical concepts in a comprehensible, coherent and rigorous way, achieved by a
carefully balanced approach. Students are encouraged to apply their mathematical knowledge to solve abstract problems as well
as those set in a variety of meaningful contexts. Mathematics: analysis and approaches has a strong emphasis on the ability to
construct, communicate and justify correct mathematical arguments. Students should expect to develop insight into mathematical
form and structure, and should be intellectually equipped to appreciate the links between concepts in different topic areas.
Students are also encouraged to develop the skills needed to continue their mathematical growth in other learning environments.
The internally assessed exploration allows students to develop independence in mathematical learning. Throughout the course
students are encouraged to take a considered approach to various mathematical activities and to explore different mathematical
ideas.
This course meets the UC C approval.
IB PHYSICS STANDARD LEVEL
The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme Physics seeks to explain the universe itself, from the very smallest
particles to the vast distances between galaxies. Despite the exciting and extraordinary development of ideas throughout the
history of physics, observations remain essential to the very core of the subject. Models are developed to try to understand
observations, and these themselves can become theories that attempt to explain the observations. Besides helping us better
understand the natural world, physics gives us the ability to alter our environments. This raises the issue of the impact of physics
on society, the moral and ethical dilemmas, and the social, economic and environmental implications of the work of physicists.
By studying physics students should become aware of how scientists work and communicate with each other. While the scientific
method may take on a wide variety of forms, it is the emphasis on a practical approach through experimental work that
characterizes the subject. Teachers provide students with opportunities to develop manipulative skills, design investigations,
collect data, analyze results and evaluate and communicate their findings.
This course meets the UC D approval.
IB PSYCHOLOGY STANDARD LEVEL
The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme (DP) standard level psychology course aims to develop an awareness
of how research findings can be applied to better understand human behaviour and how ethical practices are upheld in
psychological inquiry. Students learn to understand the biological, cognitive and sociocultural influences on human behaviour
and explore alternative explanations of behaviour. They also understand and use diverse methods of psychological inquiry.
This course meets the UC G approval.

UCCI ADVANCED INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
The UCCI (University of California Curriculum Integration) Advanced Interdisciplinary Science for Sustainable Agriculture course
combines an interdisciplinary approach to laboratory science and research with agricultural management principles. Using skills
and principles learned in the course, students design systems and experiments to solve agricultural management issues
currently facing the industry. Additionally, students will connect the products created in this class with industry activities to link
real world encounters and implement skills demanded by both colleges and careers. The course culminates with an agriscience
experimental research project in which students design and conduct an experiment to solve a relevant issue. Final projects will
be eligible for Career Development Event competition at FFA events. Throughout the course, students will be graded on
participation in intracurricular FFA activities as well as the development and maintenance of an ongoing Supervised Agricultural
Experience (SAE) program
This course meets the UC D approval.
