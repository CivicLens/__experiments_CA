Public Content
DESCRIPTION:September is Attendance Awareness Month and as students are welcomed back to school, the District stresses
the importance of school attendance. The campaign for the September Attendance Awareness offers a great opportunity to
promote awareness and the value of each instructional minute.
The message to share is that children will learn and succeed in the classroom when the barriers to attendance are removed,
good attendance patterns are established and schools celebrate success in punctual and improved attendance.
Attendance also improves when schools closely monitor chronic absence and engage in personalized early outreach and
support to students. OUSD has had success by monitoring chronic absenteeism with the Model School Attendance Review
Board (SARB) program which monitors chronic absenteeism by grade level, ethnicity, and special programs to identify groups at
risk and provide targeted early interventions. Using these baselines chronic absence data enables the District to closely monitor
progress and set goals aligned with the Learning Continuity and Attendance Plan.
As the new school year begins, the theme for September Attendance Awareness Month is "Present, Engaged and Supported!"
TheBoard of Educationwill adopt the proclamation declaring the month of September as Attendance Awareness Month.

revised. The revisions are identified in the attached second reading for this policy.

/guardian notification shall occur when the school counselor, school psychologist and/or principal has reasonable cause to
believe that involvement of the parent/guardian would result in a clear and present danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the
student of any age. At the same time, this policy will also protect the confidentiality and limited disclosure regarding students age
12 years or older receive in the process of counseling from a school counselor per Education Code section 49602.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The Gann Amendment provides a ceiling, or limit, on each year's appropriations of tax dollars by each taxreceiving agency, including the state, cities, counties, school districts, and special districts. Proposition 4, an initiative passed in
November 1979, added controls on the growth in appropriations (Article XIII-B of the California Constitution). Using 1978-79 as a
base year, subsequent year appropriations limits have been adjusted for: (1) An inflation increase equal to the change in the
Consumer Price Index, or per capita personal income, whichever is smaller, and (2) the change in the population, which for
school agencies is the change in ADA. Proposition 111 was adopted in June 1990 and amended the Gann Limit inflation factor
to be based only on the change in per capita personal income.
The starting point for the 2023-24 Gann Limit calculation is the agency's 2022-23 Gann Limit which has increased by this year's
inflation factor and by the District's percentage increase in ADA. A second calculation is made to determine those revenues that
are subject to the limit and ensure that a school agency is not over its limits.Not all revenue sources count against the District's
Gann Limit. Gann Limits only constrain the appropriations from state and local tax sources, and so federal aid is excluded as well
as non-tax income, such as revenues from cafeteria sales or adult education fees. It is by virtue of this calculation that almost
every school district and county office of education's expenditures are exactly at theirGann Limit. Orange Unified School District
is no exception.
In accordance with Article XIII-B of the California Constitution, a resolution must be adopted annually regarding the
appropriations limit for current and preceding fiscal years. Approval of this resolution will fulfill that requirement.
RECOMMENDATION: It is recommended that the Board of Education adopt Resolution No. 09-23-24: Gann Amendment
Appropriations Limit, for the current and preceding fiscal years in accordance with Article XIII-B of the California Constitution.
FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact on the district. (Rivera/Bulsara)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of

waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give the districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term needs.
This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential authorization for
one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover assignments
when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while searching for an
individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It also allows the
individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.
The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.
FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact on the district.
