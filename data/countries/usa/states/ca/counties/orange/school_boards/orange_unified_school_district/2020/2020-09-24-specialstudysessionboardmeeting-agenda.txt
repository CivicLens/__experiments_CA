Type :

Action

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
Resolution No. 13-20-21 to approve the PARS
Supplementary Retirement Plan, a retirement incentive offer
for eligible employees, and the associated PARS
Agreement for Administrative Services.

Goals :

4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content

DESCRIPTION:District leadership has worked with Public Agency Retirement Services (PARS) to design a Supplementary
Retirement Plan (SRP), a retirement incentive offer that may encourage eligible employees to retire/separate from service. The
goal of the program is to generate savings by increasing the numbers of retirements in the 2020-2021 school year. The program
allows the District to offer the plan, conduct enrollments, analyze the participation, and conduct an analysis of the fiscal viability
of the offering. The Board of Education retains the right to not proceed with the offering depending upon employee participation
levels and overall fiscal implications.
The SRP, as proposed, would provide participating employees with a monthly benefit calculated utilizing 70% of their final year
salary paid into the plan over a five-year period. PARS will assist the District in the design, perform plan communication and
enrollment, and conduct all ongoing administration of the program. PARS has worked with the District in past retirement incentive
offers in 2002-2003 and 2007-2008.

FISCAL IMPACT:The Supplementary Retirement Plan (SRP) is designed to generate savings for the District. The ultimate
savings or cost of the program will be determined based on the actual number of enrolled employees and the final assumptions
used. A final analysis based on the actual enrolled employees will be presented to the District after the close of the enrollment
window. If the District cancels the plan due to insufficient participation, a one-time fee of $5,000 will apply to cover administrative
costs.
