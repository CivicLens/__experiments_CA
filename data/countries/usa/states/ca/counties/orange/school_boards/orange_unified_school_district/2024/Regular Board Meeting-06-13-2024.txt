Goals :

4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Proposition 98 regulates school district funding. In 2014, Proposition 2 was passed limiting the levels for
Proposition 98 reserves. If the state reserve levels exceed 3% of the total Proposition 98 expenditures for TK-12, that triggers a
10% cap on local district reserves. If a district has reserve funds exceeding 10%, the overage must be designated for other
purposes, with those purposes specified for the Board to review and approve through a resolution. The 2021-22 state budget act
triggered the reserve cap. Thus, the District, through Resolution 29-23-24, is providing a list of designated uses for the overage
for the Board's approval for the 2024-25 fiscal year.
FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact on the district.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: At the February 8, 2024 board meeting, the Board of Education approved Resolution 20-23-24 authorizing
submittal and participation in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2023 Clean School Bus Rebate Program for ZeroEmission (Electric) School Buses. The EPA planned to fund at least $500 million. Each school district was allowed to submit one
application with a maximum number of 25 school buses. The District submitted an application to replace 25 school buses that
met the criteria and was awarded all 25 school buses, totaling approximately $4.505M.
Since the Transportation Department was able to acquire new school buses (Electric and CNG charter-style school buses), the
District would like to accept 17 school buses awarded through EPA - totaling approximately $2.795M. This grant allows for the
replacement of Type A (conventional buses used on special education routes) and Type D (transit buses).EPA can also be
stacked with the 14 vouchers previously awarded through the Hybrid Vehicle Incentive Program (HVIP), which, in aggregate are
worth approximately $2.778M. Since the District is interested in accepting 17 school buses through the EPA grant award, we will
apply for an additional three HVIP vouchers. Receiving confirmation for the additional HVIP vouchers can take approximately
one month from the time of submittal.
The approved board agenda item on February 8, 2024 authorized the use of $1.148M of the transportation grant to acquire the
buses. If the District is not awarded the three additional HVIP vouchers, the total fiscal impact to the District would be
approximately $2.132M. Thus, the District is seeking authorization to use an additional $984,000 of the transportation grant to
purchase the school buses. Should the district be awarded additional HVIP vouchers, the total cost to the District would be
$1.538M, in which case the District would use an additional $390,000 of the transportation grant for the purchase.
FISCAL IMPACT: Transportation Grant not to exceed $984,000

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: As part of the Transportation fleet, OUSD currently has 17 Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) buses and eight
more CNG buses on order, that utilize Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) as the fuel source.
The purpose of this contract with U.S. Venture, Inc. (formerly U.S. Gain) is to receive Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) for the
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) school buses and provide funding back to the District through the sharing of the RNG incentive
dollars. RNG can be made from sources of green plant waste, animal waste, and landfills. The waste is then processed through
digesters to make natural gas and brought to a pipeline-quality composition. It is then injected into the underground natural gas
pipeline delivery network. It is identical in every way to natural gas that is produced from underground wells.
U.S. Venture, Inc. (formerly U.S. Gain), owns RNG production facilities, and they are offering to provide dairy RNG to the District.
Dairy RNG has a lower carbon intensity with the same specifications than the landfill RNG the District is receiving today.
Additionally, U.S. Venture, Inc. will offer a share of D3 RINS, which is part of the Federal Renewable Fuel Standard program. In
total, this results in an increase of $0.29/GGE (Gasoline Gallon Equivalent).
The District continues to pay their regular Southern California Gas Company utility bill, but will receive a percentage of the
incentives available from using RNG. California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
administer the program. The initial term of the agreement begins on October 1, 2024, and ends on the 5th anniversary of the
commencement date; however, RNG has indicated that it would begin compensating the district at the increased rate once the
Board approves the agreement.
The breakdown below shows how this compares economically to the District's current agreement with U.S Venture, Inc.
Furthermore, the new rates will be applied as soon as U.S. Venture, Inc. receives the newly executed contract and dispensing
affidavit.

credits is valued at approximately $0.21 gasoline gallon equivalent* (GGE).

DESCRIPTION:Textbooks and supplementary instructional texts are reviewed by teacher committees from respective grade

recommendations to the District Curriculum Council for review and consideration. The District Curriculum Council (DCC) is made
up of representative teachers from elementary, middle, and high schools. In addition, there are site administrators from all school
levels and central office administrators on the Council. The DCC is an advisory council that addresses universal and specific
issues that either directly or indirectly impact curriculums offered in Orange USD schools. The Council will make
recommendations to the Superintendent and Board of Education after thoroughly researching and discussing each issue and its
potential impact on student achievement. Texts for CTE courses are previously approved by the Central County ROP/Career
Technical Education Partnership (CTEp).

It is at this juncture that the Board of Education places the texts and/or supplementary texts on a "30-day review period" so
members of the public may have an opportunity to review those texts, pending formal adoption. The texts are available for review
in the Board Room this evening and after tonight in the Office of Curriculum and Instruction, Building D. After the 30-day review
period, the Board of Education may take formal action to adopt the textbooks and/or supplementary texts.

DESCRIPTION:The sixth-grade students from La Veta Elementary, under the supervision of teachers, Andrew Matos, Michelle
Kauten, and Lisa Shipman, as well as trained camp staff, will participate in the Emerald Cove Outdoor Science School program.
This three-day program provides students an opportunity to explore established trails, investigate geological features, observe
wildlife, and compare plant adaptations. Students will study the night sky through telescopes, participate in line and fold dances,
create, and perform science and nature skits. The curriculum at the camp is aligned with the California Science Content
Standards and the California Science Framework. Transportation to and from the program will be provided by OUSD
Transportation. The cost per student is $290, funded by donations. No student is prevented from making the field trip due to lack
of sufficient funds per Education Code 35330(b), 35331. The students will not miss any school days.
