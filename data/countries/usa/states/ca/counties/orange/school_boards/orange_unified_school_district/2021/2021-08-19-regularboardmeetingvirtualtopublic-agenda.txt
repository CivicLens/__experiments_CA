Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content

DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover
assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

Board will provide deliverables and reports to all Orange Unified School District secondary schools for 9th 12thgraders and shift
the financial obligation from the student to the district. Shifting the financial obligation provides greater access for all high school
students to the PSAT/NMSQT and initiates students earlier entry on the road to college.
