DESCRIPTION:Public Contract Code Section 10298 allows the State to consolidate the needs of multiple state agencies for
goods, information technology, and services, and to establish contracts, master agreements, multiple award schedules,
cooperative agreements, including agreements with entities outside the state, and other types of agreements that leverage the
states buying power. Local agencies may contract with suppliers awarded those contracts without further competitive bidding
upon the same terms and conditions agreed to by the State.
On November 8, 2023, the State of California awarded California Multiple Award Schedule (CMAS) Contract Number 4-23-111017 for the purchase, warranty and installation of janitorial supplies and equipment from Waxie Enterprises, LLC., which is
effective through November 5, 2028, including future renewals. Staff recommends that the Board of Education authorize the use
of this CMAS Contract as the States volume pricing would be better than the District could obtain on its own for the Districts asneeded purchases.
It is recommended that the Board of Education approve CMAS Contract No.4-23-11-1017, awarded to Waxie Enterprises, LLC.,
