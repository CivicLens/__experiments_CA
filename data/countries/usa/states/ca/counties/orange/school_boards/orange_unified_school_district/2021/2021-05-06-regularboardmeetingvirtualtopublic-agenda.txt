Recommended Action :

Staff recommends approval of Resolution No. 24-20-21 by
the Board of Education authorizing the issuance of taxable

Goals :

Focus Area 4.7

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The Orange Unified School District (the District) provides retirement medical and other health benefits to eligible
employees and former employees pursuant to Government Code Section 53200, et seq., Education Code Section 7000, et seq.,
an implied-in-fact contract with certain leadership employees recognized by the courts, a contract with Orange Unified Education
Association, and a contract with California School Employees Association Chapter #67 (collectively, the Labor Contracts). In
2008, the District issued its Orange Unified School District Index Rate Taxable Retirement Health Benefits Funding Bonds,
Series A (the 2008 Bonds), originally issued in the principal amount of $94,765,000, to refinance a portion of the Districts liability
under the Labor Contracts. The 2008 Bonds were issued at a variable rate of interest tied to the 1-Month LIBOR index, which
index has experienced significant increases since 2015. Debt service on the 2008 Bonds is paid from the Districts General Fund.
On August 15, 2019, the Board of Education authorized District staff to prepay a portion of the 2008 Bonds using money
available for such purpose in the irrevocable trust maintained by the District for the purpose of funding the Districts Other PostEmployment Benefits (OPEB) under the Labor Contracts. As a result of such prepayment, as of October 1, 2019, the outstanding
principal balance of the 2008 Bonds was $65,935,000.
On December 19, 2019, the District issued $33,595,000 Taxable Retirement Health Benefits Refunding Bonds, Series 2019A to
refinance a portion of the 2008 Bonds to take advantage of the then-current interest rate environment.
The District now desires to refinance all the remaining outstanding 2008 Bonds through the issuance of Taxable Retirement
Health Benefits Refunding Bonds, Series 2021 (the Bonds).
The following documents are attached to this Agenda Report:
(a) Resolution. This Resolution authorizes the issuance of the Bonds, in one or more series of federally taxable bonds, specifies
the basic terms, parameters, and forms of the Bonds, and approves the forms of a Trust Agreement, Notice Inviting Proposals
for Purchase of Bonds, a Notice of Intention to Sell, a form of Preliminary Official Statement, and a form of Continuing Disclosure
Certificate, as described below. In particular, Section 2 of the Resolution establishes the maximum aggregate principal amount of
the Bonds to be issued ($35,000,000). Section 8 authorizes the Bonds to be sold at a competitive sale and authorizes Piper
Sandler & Co., the Districts Debt Advisor, to solicit bids from prospective bidders, and award the sale of the Bonds on the basis
of the lowest true interest cost.
(b) Form of Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement sets out instructions to Zions Bancorporation, National Association, as
Trustee, for the deposit and disbursement of (1) the funds received from the sale of the Bonds, and (2) money transmitted by the
District to pay the Bonds. The Trust Agreement also sets forth the terms of the Bonds and the rights of investors.
(c) Notice Inviting Proposals for Purchase of Bonds; Notice of Intention to Sell. The Resolution includes as Exhibits A and B the
forms of Notice Inviting Proposals for Purchase of Bonds and a Notice of Intention to Sell. The Resolution authorizes the Districts
Debt Advisor to distribute the Notice Inviting Proposals for Purchase of Bonds to prospective bidders and to cause the Notice of
Intention to Sell to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the boundaries of the District and in the Bond Buyer,

a national municipal securities' newspaper, to satisfy applicable legal requirements. The Notice Inviting Proposals for Purchase
of Bonds sets forth certain conditions of closing the transaction, including certain of the documentation to be provided at the
closing by various parties.
(d) Form of Preliminary Official Statement. The Preliminary Official Statement (the POS) is the offering document describing the
Bonds which may be distributed to prospective purchasers of the Bonds. The POS discloses information with respect to, among
other things, (i) the proposed uses of proceeds of the Bonds, (ii) the terms of the Bonds (interest rate, transfer terms, etc.), (iii)
the bond insurance policy for the Bonds, if any, (iv) the security for repayment of the Bonds (the general funds of the District), (v)
information with respect to the Districts tax base and other sources of revenue, (vi) District financial and operating data, (vii)
continuing disclosure with respect to the Bonds and the District, and (viii) absence of material litigation and other miscellaneous
matters expected to be of interest to prospective purchasers of the Bonds. Following the pricing of the Bonds, a final Official
Statement for the Bonds will be prepared, substantially in the form of the POS.
(e) Form of the Continuing Disclosure Certificate. The form of the Continuing Disclosure Certificate can be found in APPENDIX D
to the POS. Effective July 3, 1995, all underwriters of municipal bonds are obligated to procure from a bond issuer a covenant
that such public agency will annually file material financial information and operating data with respect to the District through the
web-based Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) system maintained by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
(which is the federal agency that regulates broker-dealers, including investment bank firms that underwrite municipal obligation
issuance). This requirement is expected to be satisfied by the filing of the Districts audited financial statements and other
operating information about the District, in the same manner, the District has filed in connection with prior bond issuances,
including the 2008 Bonds. The purpose of the law is to provide investors in the Bonds with current information regarding the
District.
FISCAL IMPACT:The proposed partial redemption of the remaining outstanding 2008 Bonds through the issuance of the Bonds
will provide for a fixed interest rate with respect to the remaining portion of the Districts outstanding 2008 Bonds, and therefore
increase the predictability of the future interest cost associated with the debt to be paid from the Districts General Fund.
