Goals :

4.0 Focus Area: Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The California Department of Education (CDE) has provided Form J-13A, Request for Allowance of Attendance
Due to Emergency Conditions, which enables school districts to file an affidavit to prevent the loss of attendance apportionment
revenue when schools are closed due to an emergency or when they remain open during an emergency, but experience a
material decrease in attendance. (Education Code Section 41422).This form, if approved by the CDE, enables districts to replace
emergency days with normal ADA, to preserve daily attendance.

On January 22, 2024, many schools throughout the district experienced decreases in excess of 10% of their normal attendance
rates due to heavy rainfall.
On February 4, 2024, Governor Newsom issued a State of Emergency for early February 2024 storms which occurred on
February 5-6, 2024, on which days the district again experienced a significant decrease in attendance rates.
The CDE determines the time period which may be used to substitute for the attendance. For the 2023-24 school year,the district
could use the school month beginning on October 9, 2023, and ending on November 3, 2023, or the school month beginning
April 29, 2024, and ending May 24, 2024, as a material decrease credit; thereby preserving the daily attendance, if the CDE
approves the District's request.
Thus, the District requests that the Board of Education approve and authorize staff to file Form J-13A, "Request for Allowance of
Attendance Due to Emergency Conditions" for these dates.

DESCRIPTION: As part of the Shade Structure Projects at Handy, La Veta, and Prospect Elementary Schools, McPherson
Magnet School, Yorba Middle School, and Richland and Villa Park High Schools, the District must complete an environmental
study and process it through the County and State, in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act, when approving
new projects that may affect District campus environments and the communities surrounding them.
Project Description:
Addition of shade structures atHandy, La Veta, and Prospect Elementary Schools, McPherson Magnet School, Yorba Middle
School, and Richland and Villa Park High Schools.
California Environmental Quality Act Compliance:
Projects undertaken by public agencies are subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) as outlined in Public
Resources Code (PRC) Section 21000 et seq. and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code Regulations, Title 14, Section
15000 et seq.). PRC section 21065 defines a project as follows:
Project means an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment or a reasonably
foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment
The proposed Shade Structure ProjectsatHandy, La Veta, and Prospect Elementary Schools, McPherson Magnet School, Yorba
Middle School, and Richland and Villa Park High Schools,are a Project under CEQA. Staff has evaluated the Project as a whole
and has determined that the proposed improvements are categorically exempt from further environmental review and the
provisions of CEQA under CEQA GuidelinesSection 15303 New Construction or Conversion of Small Structures, which states:
Class 3 consists of construction and location of limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures; installation of
small new equipment and facilities in small structures; and the conversion of existing small structures from one
use to another where only minor modifications are made in the exterior of the structure.
Staff, along with guidance from our CEQA consultant, have determined that the Project is not subject to any exceptions to the
categorical exemption (CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2). Therefore, the District may file a Notice of Exemption (NOE) for the
Project, which exempts the Project from further environmental review and the provisions of CEQA.
Current Considerations
Adoption of Resolution 01-24-25which provides the required acknowledgments and findings with respect to the Project atHandy
Elementary, La Veta Elementary, and Prospect Elementary Schools, McPherson Magnet School, Yorba Middle School, and
Richland and Villa Park High Schoolsto enable the District to:

1. Find the Proposed Project Exempt from CEQA
2. Approve the Filing and Recordation of a NOE
3. Approve the Project, and
4. Authorize staff to file the NOE for the Project with the appropriate public agencies.
Upon approval, the Notice of Exemption will be filed with the County Clerk and the State Office of Planning and Research (OPR).
The filing of a Notice of Exemption with the County Clerk starts a 35-day statute of limitations period on legal challenges to the
agency's decision that the project is exempt from CEQA.

costumes, team uniforms, club shirts, gardening supplies, multimedia technology for sound and visual projects, musical
instruments, and minimal competition registration fees in order to enhance the expanded learning opportunities and outcomes.
As a part of the California State Budget, the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program has been established to provide funding
for after-school and summer enrichment programs for transitional kindergarten/kindergarten through sixth grade as described in
Education Code, Section 46120, and established by Assembly Bill 130. It is the intent of the Legislature that the LEA offers
comprehensive before-school, after-school, and intercession-expanded learning opportunities to all unduplicated pupils in TK/K-6
classroom-based programs and shall ensure that access is proved to any unduplicated pupil whose parent or guardian requests
placement in the program. The ELOP in Orange Unified School District has been created through partnerships between schools
and local community organizations to develop the academic, social, emotional, and physical needs and interests of students
through hands-on, engaging learning experiences and extracurricular activities. When program requirements are fulfilled for
elementary school students, middle school students may also be similarly served.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: In November 2022, California voters approved Proposition 28, the Arts and Music in Schools (AMS) Funding
Guarantee and Accountability Act. Under this act, local educational agencies (LEAs) with 500 or more students must allocate at
least 80% of AMS funds to employ certificated or classified employees to provide arts education program instruction. The
remaining funds may be used for training, supplies, materials, and arts educational partnership programs, with a cap of 1% on
administrative expenses. The California Department of Education may grant a waiver exempting LEAs from the 80% staffing

requirement.AMS funding is calculated based on the previous year's student enrollment and the number of students eligible for
free or reduced-price meals (FRPM). For the 2023-2024 fiscal year, Orange Unified School District (OUSD) has been allocated
$3,768,391. The district will be given a new allocation each year and each years allocation must be used within three fiscal
years. Funds apportioned in FY 2023-24 can be spent through June 30, 2026.
During the first year of the 2023-2024 allocation, OUSD focused on evaluating current Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA)
programming, gathering feedback from parents, students, and staff, and developing school-specific plans for utilizing the funds.
Consequently, no funds have yet been expended to supplement our already existing Visual and Performing Arts programs.
Districts must submit an annual Board-approved report and post how funds were spent on their websites.

DESCRIPTION:Authorization of signatures is an item that is routinely updated to reflect personnel changes and to comply with
the requirements of the California Education Code.
As the agency that ultimately releases District payrolls and warrants, the Orange County Department of Education (OCDE) must
maintain on file the approved signature authorizations for all school districts. The signatures are applicable to various documents
that are approved by the Board of Education and in compliance with the Education Code and other pertinent state and federal
laws. The administrative/leadership employees for whom the signature authorizations are designated do not transfer that
authority to any staff members.
Purchase orders are processed within the limitations of existing site/program budgets, with the P.O. listing submitted to the
Board at each meeting. Non-routine expenditures for consultants, contracts, major facility additions, etc. are submitted to the
Board separately for authorization. Before the preparation of a warrant, it is determined that the proper authorization and
approvals exist. Warrants prepared by the District are forwarded to the OCDE for review of documentation, signature, and entry
to OUSDs county ledgers before they are returned to the District for release to vendors, consultants, or contractors. Purchase
orders, bid documents, warrants, payroll, federal/state/county documents, etc. are audited by the Districts independent audit firm.
FISCAL IMPACT:This item has no fiscal impact on the District.
