Dr. Hansen acknowledged Ed Howard who will be retiring at the end of January. Mr. Howard has been with the district for 34 years. He was a Physical
Education and social studies teacher at Orange High School for 14 years. He rose to the rank of Athletic Director at Orange High School, and held that
position for three years, until he started at Villa Park High School as Assistant Principal for two years and after as acting Principal and Principal for ten years.
He was brought to the district as a director and assisted in setting up a new department for athletics, activities, and school connectedness. Mr. Howard
served as Executive Director, Student & Community Services for six years. Dr. Hansen thanked Mr. Howard for his incredible service to Orange Unified.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Board President Yamasaki thanked Mr. Howard for all his years of service and wished him the best in his endeavors and retirement.
Usually, with the New Year, it is time for a fresh start and reflection but with the significant increase in COVID cases, it is important to keep our students and
staff safe. She thanked teachers, administration, and classified staff for providing a safe environment. The County distributed at-home COVID test kits for
students last week. Parents said the process of getting the tests at the school sites was quick, efficient, and much appreciated. Mrs. Yamasaki thanked the
staff for putting the safety of our students first.
Mrs. Yamasaki also thanked the staff for a wonderful event to open the Villa Park Science Center. A thank you goes out to the community for investing in our
students.

Board Vice President Kris Erickson acknowledged the Sports for Learning program. She has seen it at the elementary schools and was impressed. She
thanked the staff for a wonderful community event with the opening of the Villa Park High School Science Center. This represents resilience in the
community. They worked so hard to pass measure S and a community came together for the common good to help generations to come. We should all be
prideful about it.
Mrs. Erickson attended the second quarter graduation at Richland High School and was joined by Congressman Lou Correa. She helped distribute COVID
tests at El Modena High School and received a lot of great feedback from parents.
The opening of the Villa Park Science Center was an emotional day for Board Member Kathy Moffat. Seeing the completion was a dream come true, not only
for the district but also for the whole community. This will have an impact on kids for years to come. She is very grateful to those that worked and voted for
it. Mrs. Moffat read an email of gratitude from a parent in which he thanked Dr. Hansen and the staff. She announced the PTA superintendent forum that will

Board Member John Ortega started by saying that after tabling the 2 resolutions in the November meeting, there was talk about forming a subcommittee
with Dr. Hansen as mediator. As this did not happen, it is important to address the issue again and put in a new resolution. As board members are local, he
wants to be there for the community. Board Members Ledesma, Ortega, and Rumsey felt it's important to let the people know that they are for staff, parent,
and student choice.
1: Mr. Ortega makes a motion to approve Resolution 22-21-22. Second by Mr. Ledesma. The discussion continued.
Mrs. Yamasaki explained there were several attempts to create a subcommittee after the November meeting. There was no response from the three board
members who drafted the resolution. She hopes the board members can try to work together on another resolution.
Mrs. Rumsey stated she is not against vaccines. As a teacher, she is frustrated with the masks and she's worried about the social-emotional issues. She
can't argue with science, but she can't find the truth when it comes to science, and this makes it a difficult and emotional topic. It is in the hearts and minds
of the parents and it's important to talk about it. Her reason to put her name on the resolution is not to argue for or against masks and vaccines but
parents' right of choice. She's okay with working out a resolution all board members can agree on.
Mrs. Erickson wished there was a resolution that can reflect everybody. The community is representing all opinions. Members of the public are tired of the
fighting. They want us to work together, and they don't want a one-sided resolution. We represent everybody. We can't submit a resolution that only tells
one side of the story. She believes we can agree on parts of the resolution.
If something is legal or not, Mrs Erickson believes most of the legal statements set forth in the original resolutions are legally inaccurate and needs to be
accurate statement of the law.
She believes we can agree on parts of the resolution: 1) We all want to keep the schools open and safe. 2) Orange Unified is not going to create its own
vaccine requirement. 3) Illegal mandates will not be imposed. 4) We all have free will to choose. She hands out her amended resolution. She moves to
strike whereases 4-11.
2: Mrs. Erickson moves to amend the resolution as indicated. Second by Mrs. Moffat. There is a discussion. Legal Counsel Mr. DeMarco comes to the podium
to advise. Board Members can move on an individual basis.
3: Mr. Ledesma starts by adding to Whereas number 4. He suggests adding 'and/or not to obtain' as this shows parents' rights. WHEREAS Orange Unified
School District acknowledges and supports parents’ right to choose whether to obtain and/or not to obtain a COVID-19 vaccination for themselves and their
children; and. Motion to add 'and/or not to obtain' by Mr. Ledesma, second by Mrs. Rumsey. Vote: 7-0.
4: Mr. Ortega would like to add 'Staff'. WHEREAS Orange Unified School District acknowledges and supports staff and parents’ right to choose whether to
obtain and/or not to obtain a COVID-19 vaccination for themselves and their children; and. Motion to add 'staff' by Mr. Ortega, second by Mrs. Rumsey. Vote
7-0.
5: Mr. Ledesma continues with Whereas number 5. He would like to add: maintaining in-person learning, 'and if necessary online learning', for our students.
Mr. Ledesma wants to make sure that all parents know that if they have a concern for the safety of their students, there is an online option. After discussion,
the motion is changed to in-person and online learning for our students: WHEREAS Orange Unified School District is committed to maintaining in-person
and online learning for our students, and remains committed to taking only lawful mitigation measures to keep our students and staff safe; and. Mrs. Moffat
makes a motion to add online, second by Mrs. Rumsey. Vote 7-0.
6: Mr. Ledesma would like to see a change in the first Therefore: also add 'Staff and' add 'or not to vaccinate'. THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that Orange
Unified School District recognizes and supports staff and parents' right to choose whether to vaccinate or not to vaccinate their children for COVID19. Motion to make the changes by Mr. Ledesma, second by Mrs. Erickson. Vote 7-0.

Mrs. Rumsey wants to discuss the masks mandates and physical restraint: Whereas number 12. Mr. DeMarco explained the California Education Code
49005.8(a)(3).
Mr. Ortega asks Mrs. Erickson to explain her reasoning for the strikeouts. Mrs. Erickson explained that her reasoning is to create a resolution that represents
all views as the board members represent every parent. The Board is not a court of law and does not have the authority to determine if something is legal
or not. If there is a resolution, it should be completely accurate. Mr. Ortega is not comfortable with the striking, and personally supports these words. He
feels that Orange Unified needs to be heard with all school districts at the state level. He would like to lean on the law of the land and create case law. Mr.
Ledesma wants to clarify that Mr. Ortega opposes the amendment by Mrs. Erickson as presented. Mrs. Rumsey would like to see fewer strikeouts. She does
not trust the governor and wants to take the opportunity to tell the governor that it's enough.
7: There is a motion to approve the approved amendments by Mrs. Erickson. Second by Mrs. Moffat. Vote yea 4 - nay 3. Motion passes.
Next is to vote on the amended version of the resolution with strikeouts, amendments, and the new title. There is a discussion. Mrs. Rumsey supports the
part where it mentions the choice to vaccinate, but she does not agree there is no discussion about masks.
Mr. Ortega mentions there are too many strikeouts. He wants something in this resolution about masks and can't support the resolution as it is now.
8: Mrs. Erickson would like to bring back strikeout number 9. Motion by Mrs. Erickson to add the language back in. There is no second. The motion dies.
Mrs. Page asked Mr. Ortega if he, without a background in public health, wrote the resolution. Mr. Ortega confirmed he did.
9: Motion for a final vote to the amended resolution per the preceding amendments. Motion by Mrs. Erickson, second by Mrs. Moffat. Final vote: Yea: Mrs.
Yamasaki, Mrs. Erickson, Mrs. Moffat, Mrs. Page. Nay: Mr. Ledesma, Mr. Ortega, Mrs. Rumsey. The motion passes 4-3
According to the legal counsel, the original resolution does not go through a vote. There is only a vote on the amended resolution. To be transparent, Mr.
Ortega would like four copies of the resolution posted online: the original copy by Mr. Ortega, Mr. Ledesma, and Mrs. Rumsey, the copy by Mrs. Erickson, a
copy with the amendments, and a clean copy. The legal counsel mentions this is appropriate to do. The four copies are attached at the end of the minutes.

1: Resolution 22-21-22 as originally presented by Mr. Ledesma, Mr. Ortega, and Mrs. Rumsey:
RESOLUTION # 22-21-22:
A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING LOCAL DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY
REGARDING COVID-19 HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND RESCINDMENT OF THE GOVERNOR’S ILLEGAL PROPOSED VACCINATION
MANDATE
January 13, 2022
WHEREAS the Orange Unified School District (OUSD) operates 38 in-person campuses and has been a leader in getting students back in the classroom
during the COVID-19 crisis; and
WHEREAS OUSD has operated in-person learning safely since reopening in fall of 2020 without ever needing to close a campus due to COVID-19; and
WHEREAS the COVID-19 vaccine is readily available to all children ages five and up and is readily available to all adults; and

WHEREAS OUSD supports staff and families’ statutory right to choose whether to obtain the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children, but
believes the Governor’s vaccine mandate violates said statutory right to choose by forcing individuals to submit to the mandate or lose access to in-person
instruction if they are students or their jobs if they are staff; and
WHEREAS 21 USC § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III) protects the right to refuse all Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) medical products, making it illegal
under federal law to mandate such products; and the COVID vaccines (with the exception of the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine, which is not available anywhere in
the U.S.), the COVID masks, and the PCR tests are all EUA medical devices, and it is therefore illegal under this federal law to mandate any of them; and
under the Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Paragraph 2) of the United States Constitution, the United States Constitution and other federal laws take
precedence over state laws, meaning that if the Governor's mandates of EUA medical products are in conflict with the abovementioned federal law, the latter
has the final say; and
WHEREAS California Health and Safety Code § 120335(b)(11) states that only two California entities, the California legislature and the California
Department of Public Health, may mandate vaccines; and
WHEREAS California Health and Safety Code § 120338 states that all mandated vaccines must have medical and personal belief exemptions; and
WHEREAS any medical device that does not have FDA approval is considered investigational or experimental, and when someone is given an
experimental medical device, he or she is considered to be enrolled in a clinical trial; and federal law prohibits the enrollment of children in clinical trials
except under the following circumstances: 45 CFR §§ 46.404, 46.408 stipulate that in cases where the experimental medical device poses no greater than
minimal risk to children, children may only be enrolled if they have the express consent of their parents; and 45 CFR § 46.405 stipulates that in cases where
the experimental medical product poses greater than minimal risk to children, children may only be enrolled if the product presents the prospect of a direct
benefit to the child and the risk-benefit ratio of the experimental product is at least as favorable as that of alternative approaches; and since children have a
COVID-19 survival rate of 99.97% and there are enormous risks to children from the vaccines, including death, no direct benefit outweighing the risks from
the vaccines can be construed; and California Health and Safety Code §§ 24172, 24175 require written informed consent for any medical experiments; and
WHEREAS student mask mandates, which due to the EUA status of COVID masks are illegal under federal law, are also illegal under California Education
Code § 49005.8(a)(3), which states that an educational provider shall not "Use a physical restraint technique that obstructs a pupil’s respiratory airway or
impairs the pupil’s breathing or respiratory capacity," and under California Education Code § 49005.8(a)(4), which states that an educational provider shall
not "Use a behavioral restraint technique that restricts breathing, including, but not limited to, using a pillow, blanket, carpet, mat, or other item to cover a
pupil’s face;” and
WHEREAS Independent Study may not be appropriate for every student, including students with exceptional needs, per California Education Code §
51745; and
WHEREAS forcing families to participate in Independent Study violates California Education Code § 51747, which requires that Independent Study be a
voluntary education option; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that OUSD recognizes parents’ statutory right to choose whether to administer EUA vaccines, masks, and testing to their
children; and

RESOLUTION # 22-21-22:
A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING LOCAL DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY
REGARDING COVID-19 HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND RESCINDMENT OF THE GOVERNOR’S ILLEGAL PROPOSED VACCINATION
MANDATE
January 13, 2022

WHEREAS the Orange Unified School District (OUSD) operates 38 in-person campuses and has been a leader in getting students back in the
classroom during the COVID-19 crisis; and
and

WHEREAS OUSD has operated in-person learning safely since reopening in fall of 2020 without ever needing to close a campus due to COVID-19;
WHEREAS the COVID-19 vaccine is readily available to all children ages five and up and is readily available to all adults; and

WHEREAS Orange Unified School District acknowledges and supports parents’ right to choose whether to obtain a COVID-19 vaccination for
themselves and their children; and

WHEREAS Orange Unified School District is committed to maintaining in-person learning for our students and remains committed to taking only
lawful mitigation measures to keep our students and staff safe; and
WHEREAS Orange Unified School District has not created or imposed its own vaccination requirement;
WHEREAS OUSD supports staff and families’ statutory right to choose whether to obtain the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children, but
believes the Governor’s vaccine mandate violates said statutory right to choose by forcing individuals to submit to the mandate or lose access to in-person
instruction if they are students or their jobs if they are staff; and
WHEREAS 21 USC § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III) protects the right to refuse all Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) medical products, making it illegal
under federal law to mandate such products; and the COVID vaccines (with the exception of the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine, which is not available anywhere in
the U.S.), the COVID masks, and the PCR tests are all EUA medical devices, and it is therefore illegal under this federal law to mandate any of them; and
under the Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Paragraph 2) of the United States Constitution, the United States Constitution and other federal laws take
precedence over state laws, meaning that if the Governor's mandates of EUA medical products are in conflict with the abovementioned federal law, the latter
has the final say; and
WHEREAS California Health and Safety Code § 120335(b)(11) states that only two California entities, the California legislature and the California
Department of Public Health, may mandate vaccines; and
WHEREAS California Health and Safety Code § 120338 states that all mandated vaccines must have medical and personal belief exemptions; and
WHEREAS any medical device that does not have FDA approval is considered investigational or experimental, and when someone is given an
experimental medical device, he or she is considered to be enrolled in a clinical trial; and federal law prohibits the enrollment of children in clinical trials
except under the following circumstances: 45 CFR §§ 46.404, 46.408 stipulate that in cases where the experimental medical device poses no greater than
minimal risk to children, children may only be enrolled if they have the express consent of their parents; and 45 CFR § 46.405 stipulates that in cases where
the experimental medical product poses greater than minimal risk to children, children may only be enrolled if the product presents the prospect of a direct
benefit to the child and the risk-benefit ratio of the experimental product is at least as
favorable as that of alternative approaches; and since children have a COVID-19 survival rate of
99.97% and there are enormous risks to children from the vaccines, including death, no direct
benefit outweighing the risks from the vaccines can be construed; and California Health and
Safety Code §§ 24172, 24175 require written informed consent for any medical experiments; and
WHEREAS student mask mandates, which due to the EUA status of COVID masks are illegal under federal law, are also illegal under California
Education Code § 49005.8(a)(3), which states that an educational provider shall not "Use a physical restraint technique that obstructs a pupil’s respiratory
airway or impairs the pupil’s breathing or respiratory capacity," and under California Education Code § 49005.8(a)(4), which states that an educational
provider shall not "Use a behavioral restraint technique that restricts breathing, including, but not limited to, using a pillow, blanket, carpet, mat, or other
item to cover a pupil’s face;” and
WHEREAS Independent Study may not be appropriate for every student, including students with exceptional needs, per California Education Code §
51745; and
WHEREAS forcing families to participate in Independent Study violates California Education Code § 51747, which requires that Independent Study be
a voluntary education option; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that Orange Unified School District recognizes and supports parents’ right to choose whether to vaccinate their children for COVID-19; and

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that Orange Unified School District will not create its own independent COVID-19 vaccination requirement; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED Orange Unified School District is committed to following state and federal law with regard to health and safety
protocols surrounding COVID-19 and will not condition in-person learning on a vaccination requirement that is declared illegal by a court of law having
binding jurisdiction over our district.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that OUSD recognizes parents’ statutory right to choose whether to administer EUA vaccines, masks, and testing to their
children; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that OUSD recognizes staff’s statutory right to choose whether to use EUA vaccines, masks, and testing; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that OUSD will ensure that Independent Study remains optional in compliance with California law; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that OUSD urges the Governor to rescind all illegal vaccine, masking, and testing mandates as a condition of in-person
instruction and employment in grades K-12; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that OUSD will not adopt illegal COVID-19 vaccine mandates for students or staff members; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the OUSD Superintendent is directed to transmit this Resolution to: Governor Gavin Newsom; State Public Health
Officer Dr. Tomas J. Aragon; California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly; the Orange County Board of Supervisors; Orange County
Public Health Services; and the Orange County Board of Education.
