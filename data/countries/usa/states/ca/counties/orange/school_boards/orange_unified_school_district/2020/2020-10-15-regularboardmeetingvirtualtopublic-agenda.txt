Public Content
DESCRIPTION:The California Department of Education (CDE) has provided Form J-13A, Request for Allowance of
Attendance Due to Emergency Conditions, to enable the District to file an affidavit which will prevent the loss of attendance
apportionment revenue as a consequence of widespread parental and community concern due to social media threats made

towards Orange and Villa Park High Schools. Form J-13A may be filed per Education Code (EC) Section 41422, when schools
are closed due to extraordinary conditions and per EC Section 46392, when one or more schools were kept open but
experienced a material decrease in attendance.
On November 20, 2019, Orange and Villa Park High Schools experienced decreases in excess of 10% of their normal
attendance rates due to social media threats. School Districts may be held harmless from revenue loss that might otherwise
result from the loss of ADA or instructional time in emergencies. This form, if approved by CDE, will enable the District to replace
the emergency days with a normal ADA using the school month beginning on October 14, 2019, and ending on November 8,
2019, for Orange and Villa Park High Schools as a material decrease credit; thereby preserving the daily attendance.

Category :

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable term. Short-Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term
needs. This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential
authorization for one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover
assignments when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while
searching for an individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It
also allows the individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.

The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.

FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact.

DESCRIPTION:Orenda Education has designed a research-based, equity-grounded model to support educators in providing a
high-quality education for every student. The Teacher Workshop, Lesson Online, Coaching Overview (TLC) Model is designed to
successfully impact students regardless of whether they are receiving face to face instruction, enrolled in ahybrid model or 100%
engaged in virtual learning. The TLC toolkit and aligned Professional Development Series will help strengthen the overall
facilitation and implementation of our OUSD Slice Virtual Learning Modes. The professional development series will focus on
designing online instruction that is aligned to grade-level rigor and research based best practices, to ensure students stay
engaged and focused on instructional targets. Following is a synopsis of what is covered in the Professional Development
Series:
Alignment and Calibration of core content
Identifying targets and standards
Calibrating target standards by grade level content
Teachers role when placing students on computer
Guidelines for reviewing online content
Using online learning to enhance not replace teaching
Vetting online resources ex video clips
Planning robust lessons
Using weekly/unit planning templates

How to provide differentiated support to students
Small group instruction in a face to face & virtual classroom
All TK- 12th grade teachers will be grouped by grade level and/or grade level span for elementary and by content discipline for
secondary. In order to provide continued support to teachers, all administrators and district office staff will also participate in a
Leadership Series that will focus on the tenets of being an equity leader. In addition, all counselors and paraeducators will be
participating in a three-day PD that focuses on how to support students in our Orange Slice Instructional Models. Professional
Development will also encompass a deeper focus for fifteen (15) schools that have committed to participating in theOrenda
Discovery Study, which serves as a baseline study to help schools and district leaders understand the systems and conditions
that are producing current student outcomes, particularly for our most at-risk students. The study informs an action plan that
maximizes results for students.
