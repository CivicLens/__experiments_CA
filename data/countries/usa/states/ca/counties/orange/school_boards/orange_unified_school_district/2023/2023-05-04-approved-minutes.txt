Games and the Special Olympics back to our district. This morning, she attended the Canyon PTA meeting where the PTA gave
out awards to those that made a difference. She gave her EDGE coin to Ms. Elizabeth Fisher who made a difference to the
students in her library. Ms. Fisher is retiring at the end of the school year and will be missed. The board will participate in the
May Parade and Ms. Yamasaki encouraged everyone to attend.
Trustee Miner had the opportunity to go to Fort Irwin National Training Center where she got a tour from the Army and flew

Trustee Page mentioned that there are a lot of celebrations this month. She extended her personal thanks to the teachers
and thanked them for all they do for our students. It's also Mental Health Month. She is grateful for Mr. Erven and his creative
ways of finding additional grants, so every school now has a counselor that is able to visit every single classroom. Before,
many students needed to see counselors but the counselors only had enough time to see potentially severe cases.
Trustee Ortega thanked and congratulated all students that made CIF this week. He mentioned that he understands how
hard it is to balance school and sports.
Student Board Member Madison Salloum of Canyon High School mentioned that the AP exams caused a lot of stress. The
Dance Company always puts on a huge production in May and she encouraged the audience to attend. Many spring sports
made it to CIF. Congratulations to Boys Tennis, Boys Golf, Boys and Girls Lacrosse, Track, Softball, and Baseball. Prom will be
held on May 20th and there is a Dodge Ball Tournament coming up. Madison thanked all her teachers that were special to her
but specifically mentioned Mr. Gaulin, AP Gov/Econ at Canyon High School.

realized that this was the last time dancing together. Nature Center dedication. Ruby enjoyed the beautiful celebration for the
Nature Center Dedication. El Modena held an athletic night at Fred Kelly Stadium to showcase athletic programs to prospective

Psychology and AP US History teacher Dr. Chapman, an amazing teacher and a great dancer.
Student Board Member Diego Paz of Orange High School also mentioned AP testing month. AVID staff and student leaders
organized a College week that was filled with activities for students that continue their education. Diego also mentioned the
time capsule event and thanked the board members that attended. Diego thanked his 4th-grade teacher at Lampson
Elementary, Ms. Bair. She saw his potential and encouraged him to attend the GATE program at Palmyra. It changed the
trajectory of his life and it shows how important teachers are.
Student Board Member Hope Kimera of Villa Park mentioned that Mr. Larios hosted an Esports event that received
extremely positive feedback. AP testing is stressful as a lot of seniors suffer from senioritis. There are many events scheduled
this month: Spirit Week, College Commitment Day, Prom, the annual dodgeball tournament, a flag football tournament, and a
staff appreciation breakfast. Baseball and Track & Field moved on to CIF. Hope thanked senior staff clerk Ms. Nunez as she is
important to him and other students. He can always talk to her and that made a big impact on him.

17. PUBLIC COMMENT
Procedural: A. Non-Agenda Items: Members of the audience may address the Board of Education on non-agenda items that
are within the Board’s subject matter jurisdiction. Speaking time is limited to three (3) minutes per speaker with a maximum
of twenty (20) minutes per topic. Persons wishing to speak should submit a Public Comment card prior to the meeting. Nonagenda items may neither be acted upon nor discussed by the Board, but will be responded to either by telephone, mail, or at
a subsequent meeting.
Britt: lack of leadership by Trustee Erickson. Don't politicize.
Lorrie Kaylor: transgender identity. Don't keep information from parents. Schools need to inform parents if students identify
as a gender other than what's on their birth certificate.
Jolin Lang: Inclusion and diversity are most important. Everyone needs to have a voice.
Frank Rodriguez: feedback on social media accounts of board members. Developed templates for all. A cohesive message
brings the district together.
Brooke Ikemura, OUSD student: styrofoam food trays should be banned. She has over 800 signatures for the ban.
Britney Ikemura, OUSD student: styrofoam harms the earth and human health. Switch to paper trays.
Alex Brewsaugh, OUSD parent: clarified that Kris Erickson has nothing to do with the recall. He pulled Form 700s. Miner did it
correctly. Rumsey and Ortega did not. Things are missing.
Joette: thanked the board majority for protecting parents. Stand up to those who want CRT, trash books in libraries, and a
trans agenda.
John Sanks, OUSD parent: why wait until the day of the meeting to pull items?
Florita Sheldon, OUSD parent: Planned parenthood attending El Modena as part of a student event is not acceptable. Should

not be allowed on campus.
JJ Meiss, OUSD parent: no comment
Darshan Smaaladen, OUSD parent: There is an email to OCCA parents about being on the board agenda for accommodation.
Esplanade parents should be able to defend themselves at the meetings when there is a predatory charter school next to their
school.
