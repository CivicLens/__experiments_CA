Dr. Hansen said it was her pleasure this evening to honor outgoing Board President, Alexia Deligianni-Brydges, for her leadership during the past two years.  She read the highlights of the District's successes and great programs that were approved, under the leadership of Dr. Deligianni-Brydges, during these past two years, while she was the President of the Board of Education.

She said it was a pleasure and an honor to work Dr. Hansen and each of the Board Members.  Dr. Hansen commented that she was also looking forward to working with the new Board President, Mr. John Ortega.  
  Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Mr. Ortega stated that he hoped everyone enjoyed Christmas and the New Year. He commented that we are one of the only districts that start this late after the holiday. He wished everyone a great New Year, 2020. He stated that over the break, it gave him an opportunity for self reflection and to think about areas where he can improve.  He said  where I see those improvements and how they can be integrated into what we are trying to accomplish as a whole.   We have a lot of great things going on, it's been mentioned many times. Dr. Hansen mentioned the Orange Unified's great credit rating, with money savings for community to be put back into our facilities.  He stated it's exciting to see the construction at our sites, after all these years. Orange Unified is fiscally sound, we are one of the few, districts that can say that. Many districts are struggling right now.  Board President, Ortega said that in looking at how we can continue, this is something that we have discussed, as a board, relationships, efficiency of time and being respectful of each other, and the audience, regardless of what it is.  We can agree to disagree but at the end of the day we still respect each other.  Be able to step back for self reflection. How and what I believe needs to more out front; show humility and know good leadership is servant leadership. Follow before you lead. It is important to learn how to do that.  I am encouraged and overall very positive, being able to be happy to move forward as a group. I want to be able to be respectful of everybody, agree to disagree and reflect on that.  I wish everybody a great and prosperous 2020.
  Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Dr. Hansen introduced Mrs. Sara Pelly, Principal of Fletcher Elementary and the Mandarin Immersion Program. Mrs. Pelly thanked the Board for moving the agenda item up for bedtime.   She gave a quick overview of the program stating that 2012, was the start of the Mandarin Immersion Program, starting when the Seal of Bi-literacy Program in the State was passed. The OUSD Mandarin Program is now in it's 8 year and has nine different grade levels across two schools, with students at Cerro Villa and next year, across three schools as students will promote to Villa Park High School. Principal Pelly pointed out the slides from past Lunar New Year Celebrations. She also told the audience that Fletcher Mandarin Immersion Program was recently awarded with the California School Boards Association "Golden Bell Award". She said it is such an honor to win such a prestigious award, and she said it speaks to the dedication and hard work of the teachers in the program.  She thanked the teachers, the amazing parents and the students for their support and hard work. She thanked the School Board and the District for their support as well.   She announced that this year the Lunar New Year Celebration will be held at Memorial Hall at Chapman University as the event has outgrown the playground at Fletcher Elementary.  She invited everyone to attend.  Three student emcees came to the mic and introduced the program. The students explained the New Year Celebration and the association with the animals of the Chinese Zodiac.  This year is the Year of the Rat.  The children sang the popular Lunar New Year song, which translated means "Congratulations, Congratulations" and the performance was enjoyed by the all.  
  Kathy Moffat stated that she had some recognitions.   She said that it's time for civic engagement because right around the corner, we have a primary election coming up.  It's earlier than usual, it's changed to March 3rd and there is a new way of voting,. The ballots will be coming in the mail before the end of this month, so don't throw away your ballot. All the ballots will be mailed in or you can take them to vote centers. The other important thing is that you can start voting 10 days ahead of the election itself. We will actually be voting in February.  There is a proposition on the ballot, that very important to school districts and particularly school districts that may be looking to apply for matching grants. School districts that have made facilities improvements and obviously, we are making lots of facilities improvements and it is very important to us that the state have a sufficient coffer of money that provides a fund to which we can apply to get matching fund grants for the millions of dollars that we are putting into our schools.  And that proposition is Proposition 13 of 2020. It is different from the other Prop 13. It has to do with funding and matching grants so please take care when the ballot pamphlet comes to you and give serious consideration. And perhaps, the Board will support this and might want to put a resolution on the agenda to support this Proposition at the next board meeting. It would mean so much to our constituents, our residents here, as it would extend our dollars to improve our schools.
  And secondly, Ms. Moffat would like to recognize, with mixed emotions, the departure of OUSD's wonderful Principal of Richland Continuation High School, Dr. Elsie Briseno-Simonovski. This is her last week of service here at Orange Unified, as she is moving on to a position of higher responsibility at the Buena Park School District as Director of Child Welfare and Attendance.  She has been such a blessing to Orange Unified School District, to Richland High School and mostly to our students. During the five and a half years that she has been principal of Richland High School, it has been selected as a Model Continuation School, two years in a row and that is a huge honor. Under her direction, the school has grown leaps and bounds, they have a STEM lab, they have AP classes, they are leading the state in terms of offerings at a continuation high school. We have had students come before this Board to give heartfelt endorsements of the experiences they have had at Richland High School.  They have been able to not only recover their credits, which is goal number one, but also reorder their priorities and get a better hold on their academic performance.  Bon Voyage to Elsie, we will never forget her individually or the contributions she has made to Richland. 
Student Board member Jason Gonzalez, representing Richland asked to speak.  He said that in the one year that he has been a student at Richland, Dr. Briseno-Simonovski has always been there for him and made going to Richland, a very welcoming experience. Jason wanted to thank her for that. 
  Board Clerk, Brenda Lebsack, spoke of the CSBA conference, the annual conference for California School Board members, that she recently attended in early December.  She said that she attended various sessions and workshops about things going on statewide.  One of the sessions that she attended was being sensitive to immigrant students.  It was led by an immigration attorney and, in regard to voting, since many of the school districts including our district, encourage students to register to vote on campus early so that when they do turn 18 they will already be registered to vote.  The attorney mentioned that students often times are undocumented and don't know it, because parents may not tell them. If a student registers to vote and, they don't know they are undocumented then, this would be presenting yourself falsely and could actually prevent a student from getting citizenship. Ms. Lebsack said that she didn't know if anyone else knows this, but she wanted to share so that we would be aware. This is something we need to think about and consider and I did learn that, in one of my workshops. 
  Kris Erickson requested to speak. She wished everyone a Happy New Year. She commended the student Board Members for attending the last meeting, as it was very long.  She said that the Board Members always enjoy hearing from the students.  She said Jason did a great presentation on Richland, and she is looking forward to hearing Rylee's presentation tonight.  She said that it was a somewhat of a contentious board meeting, but the students stood up and spoke eloquently and as a school district they are models of what we want in our students, and that is to take  in information and to speak out even though it may be intimidating to speak out.  Yet you showed a lot of bravery, and she wants to comment the students and encourage them to keep speaking out, speak truth to power, even if, we are the power.  Keep participating, your voice is so critically important, so thank you
  Information: D. State of the School Report - Villa Park High School - Rylee Gordon
Student Board Member, Rylee Gordon, representing Villa Park High School, presented on Villa Park High with a video of the construction that is taking place at Villa Park High School. She said that this year has been a little different with many obstacles but no matter what, the Spartan persevere and always march forward. She said that even with all the construction at the school, Villa Park has the best attendance in November in the District and for that Principal, Dr. Miller, shaved his head. She said that VPHS, known for their amazing assemblies relocated outside to the amphitheater for the assemblies.  She told how great the student of VPHS handled the relocation of many school events due to the construction event with there was always plenty of school spirit.  Nothing stopped the Spartans from marching forward. The video was put together with the help of ASB and the media department.  Villa Park High School has great school spirit and it is apparent at all of their games.

Board Vice President Kathy Moffat asked to speak quickly on three items.  Spoke of Santiago Charter and it's beginning, twenty-five years ago and the team that was instrumental in the development of the Charter at that time.  She wanted also to speak on the new method of voting and that this is a big change and wondered if through our parent communications if the district could let parents and community know of the new procedure and changes.  With some big measures on this ballot it would be beneficial to the District.   Dr. Hansen stated that staff will review legality and protocol regarding the District sharing out this information. Kathy suggested that we do it.  She also asked if we could add a resolution for the new Proposition 13 of 2020 to the agenda in February. Mr. Harvey said that it would be a big thing for the District due to matching funds and could mean 20 million dollars to our District and possibly more.   Dr. Hansen said that Business Services is preparing a resolution and it will be in the Friday letter.
