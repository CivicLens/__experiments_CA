Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and the Local Control and Accountability Plan
(LCAP) regulations require that each districts LCAPapproval and adoptionbe held in a subsequent meeting and separate from
the Public Hearing on the LCAP (Education Code 52062 (b). In addition, the approval of the LCAP must be at the same meeting
as the approval and adoption of the District Budget pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), Section 42127.New this year,
LEA's must measure and report their progress regarding the local indicators for each state priority area, at the same meeting as
the adoption of the LCAP. Local indicatorswe must progress monitor are: Basic Services (1), Implementation of State Standards
(2), Parent Engagement (3), SchoolClimate (6), Access to Broad Course of Study (7).
The LCAP Public Hearing was held at the May 20thBoard of Education meeting to allow for public comment and
recommendations regarding the specific goals, actions and expenditures proposed in the LCAP and budget.The Board of
Education also received an information item on the LCAPin Weekly Board Updates.

The contents of the LCAP havebeen shared with the Superintendents District Advisory Council (DAC), District English Learner
Advisory Committee (DELAC), and various stakeholder committees. An intensive community engagement process beginning in
January 2021 resulted in continuous refinement of the LCAP actions and services. In addition, the LCAP was formed by surveys,
stakeholder input meetings, and consultation with the employee associations.
This next year we begin a new three-year cycle of our previous LCAP. Goals and actions were reviewed and revisedto align with
our current strategic plan, theEDGE:Excellence in Academics and Leadership;Dedicated and Engaged Communication; Genuine
Wellness and Safety; and Efficient Utilization of Fiscal Capital.
The LCAP goals, services and actions were further refined to include comments and recommendations from a multitude of
stakeholders. Numerous stakeholder committees including local School Site Councils (SSC) and school level committees have
provided feedback. This intensive community engagement process began in January 2021 resulting in continuous improvement
of the planthrough an analysis of student learning outcomes, surveys, stakeholder input meetings and consultation with the
employee associations.
The development and adoption of a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) by local boards of education is a requirement
intended to provide transparency on the goals, progress indicators, actions, and services to improve student outcomes and detail
how expenditures are aligned to those actions. Orange Unified School Districthas determined main goals for the state Priorities
to organize the actions and services. In addition, goals were analyzed and reflected uponfrom the 2019-2020 Year Three LCAP
through an annual updateas well as an annual update of the Learning Continuity Plan put in place to address the needs during
the pandemic during the 2020-21 school year.
The development and adoption of the LCAP is the state-mandated strategic planning process for districts across the State of
California.Actions and services identifiedare directly aligned to LCFF funding and will be under continual renewal through the
LCAP annual update process.
The Board of Education received the DraftLCAPand the District's summary of stakeholder engagement. The notification for the
2021-2024 Year OneLocal Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) public hearing was published in the Orange County Register.
The required LCAPpublic hearing was held on May 20th. The LCAP continues to be posted online and is available for public
inspection at the District Administrative Offices.

DESCRIPTION: Effective 2014-15, Education Code section 52062(b)(2) requires the school district governing board adopt its
budget at a public meeting. This meeting shall be held after, but not on the same day as, the public meeting at which the
governing board holds the required public hearing. The public hearing of the proposed budget was held during the May 20, 2021
board meeting.
Average Daily Attendance: The 2021-22 Budget is constructed on the following student population:
ADA
OUSD

22,906.65

Non-Public Schools

37.65

Community Day School

25.70

Santiago Charter MS

981.80

Orange County Classical Academy

391.91

Sub Total (Charter Schools Only)

2,441.91

GRAND TOTAL

26,329.02

The total budgeted attendance of 22,970.00 (not including District charter schools, county special education, county community
schools, and SB1446 declining enrollment protection) reflects an anticipated decline of 346.11 in District ADA. District charter
schools ADA of 2,441.91 reflects a decline of 37.17 as compared to the prior year.
Revenues: The following chart shows the driving factors of the LCFF in addition to ADA:
Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)

3.84%

Transitional Gap Funding

100.00%

3 Year Rolling Unduplicated English Learner (EL), Free/ Reduced (F/R) and Foster Youth (FY)
Student Percentage

49.32%

Until the state adopts its 2021-22 Budget, the proposed funded LCFF yields an estimated $7,845,703 increase as compared to
the prior year primarily due to the COLA.

Most state categorical entitlements and grants known to be ongoing are projected at current levels. Only special education

Proposition 20).

increases for certificated employees and step/range increases for classified employees. Statutory benefits (STRS, PERS,
Workers Compensation, etc.) are driven by payroll costs. Health benefits are based on current employer contribution levels.
Expenditures: Supplies, services/operating expenses, and capital outlay are in conformity with the estimated site and program
budgets.
Estimated unexpended entitlements shown as components of the 2020-21 ending fund balance have been added to the 2021-22
budget expenditure lines. Estimated unexpended entitlements include: Medi-Cal Billing Option, Restricted Lottery, Huber Trust,
and Classified Employee Professional Development Block Grants of approximately $1.9 million.

of school site/department donations, Credential Support Contracts, MediCal Administration Activities programs, Textbooks, and
school site Lottery carryover are added in the 2021-22 Budget expenditure lines. The remaining assignments include reserves
for Attract & Retain Students, STRS/PERS Increases, Enrollment Decline and Fund 12-CARES Transfer balances.

Revolving Cash

$100,000

Stores

$150,000

Attract & Retain Students (One-Time Mandated Cost)

$3,492,119

STRS/PERS Increases

$1,700,000

indicators; Academic Indicator English/Language Arts, Academic Indicator Math, English Learner Progress, Suspension Rate,

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education adopt
Resolution No. 22-20-21 granting signature authorization
for specific District administrative/leadership employees as
indicated on the attached document.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Authorization of signatures is an item that is routinely updated to reflect changes in personnel and to comply
with the requirements of the California Education Code.
As the agency which ultimately releases District payrolls and warrants, the Orange County Department of Education (OCDE)
must maintain on file the approved signature authorizations for all school districts. The signatures are applicable to various
documents which are approved by the Board of Education and in compliance with the Education Code and other pertinent state
and federal laws. The administrative/leadership employees for whom the signature authorizations are designated do not transfer
that authority to any staff members.

Purchase orders are processed within the limitations of an existing site/program budget, with the Purchase Orderlisting
submitted to the Board at each meeting. Non-routine expenditures for consultants, contracts, major facility additions, etc. are
submitted to the Board separately for authorization. Before the preparation of a warrant, it is determined that the proper
authorization and approvals exist. Warrants prepared by the District are forwarded to OCDEfor review of documentation,
signature, and entry to Orange USDs county ledgers before they are returned to the District for release to vendors, consultants,
or contractors. Purchase orders, bid documents, warrants, payroll, federal/state/county documents, etc. are audited by the
Districts independent audit firm.
