Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Hansen introduced County Superintendent of Schools Dr. Mijares, Anaheim Hills Principal Mrs. Van Wilgen Moore, and Anaheim
Hills teacher Mrs. Grassbaugh. Dr. Mijares, who is here tonight to give out an award to Anaheim Hills Elementary, thanked the Board
President and Board Members, Dr. Hansen, Cabinet, and the public. He mentioned it's an honor to provide a trophy to the school
district and the school for closing the achievement gap. It's a very distinct award, given to an outstanding school district and school.
There are almost 6000 elementary schools in California and only 28 were given this award, seven of them in Orange county. Dr.
Mijares celebrates and commends Anaheim Hills for earning the highest honors. There is nothing more sacred than investing in the
lives of our students. He thanked Mrs. Van Wilgen Moore, Mrs. Grassbaugh, and the staff of California Elementary.
Dr. Hansen congratulated Kayla Grassbaugh, a teacher at Anaheim Hills Elementary and an OC Top Teacher Finalist. A video was
shown.
Dr. Hansen also mentioned the celebration of the grand opening of the Canyon High School Science Center. A video was shown about
the students having their first classes in the building and the grand opening. The opening of the El Modena High School Science
Center will be later this month.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Board president Yamasaki thanked Dr. Mijares for taking the time to be here tonight. She also congratulated Principal Van Wilgen
Moore and Mrs. Grassbaugh.
She mentioned the celebration of the opening of the Canyon High School Science Center. Mrs. Yamasaki attended the opening with a
feeling of immense pride and joy. Her children attended Canyon High School. She started as a Volunteer, got involved with CARE,
and to see everything come to completion is amazing and emotional. Mrs. Yamasaki and Trustee Page attended the Canyon High
School showcase. She was amazed by the number of former parents that came back to celebrate. She's grateful for the number of
community members and parents that supported the bond and the effort that they took to get it passed. This new building stands
for our core values: equity, integrity respect, and excellence. She's so proud and excited for our students to have this state-of-theart building to enhance their learnings.
Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff, and Community
Board Member Kathy Moffat mentioned the opening of the Canyon High School Science Center. It started with just a dream and now
it's a fantastic building. Students and parents said it was beyond what they imagined. She was happy to share this with Mrs.
Erickson, and Mrs. Yamasaki. She also attended the Villa Park High School Showcase. Enabling the students to pursue their dreams
and goals is what energizes Mrs. Moffat to be here. We have the opening of the El Modena Science Center to look forward to. It's
great to be in Orange Unified.
Board Member Kris Erickson also mentioned Canyon High School. She visited Canyon High School with Andrea Yamasaki on the first

day the students took their seats. She was interviewed by a student for the Canyon High School Magazine. The students asked how
this happened, how it started. People with passion came together and got it done. Something small grew to thousands of people that
kept fighting for it. It took from 2013 to 2022. People in the community, as divided as we may be on all sorts of things, when we all
come together we can build amazing things. She thanked everybody involved.
Board Member Ana Page recognized all Mandarin Immersion students. A couple of days ago, students from three different campuses
celebrated Lunar New Year. It's so wonderful to see that it's a well-rounded program, that not only teaches the language but also the
culture. She's looking forward to the Lunar New Year celebration at Fletcher.
Student Board Member Eliana Lipson mentioned all the events that El Modena has coming up: the winter sports assembly, honor roll
assembly, the opening of the Science Center, winter formal, academic showcase, and spirit week.
Information: D. Board Recognition – “YOU'VE GOT THE EDGE” – Employee Of The Month Recognition Program
Dr. Hansen introduced Nancy Whitehead, School Office Manager at Olive Elementary School, who is the recipient of the "You've got
the Edge" - Employee of the Month Award for the month of February. Board President Yamasaki read what the Olive Staff
Administration had to say about Nancy: "Mrs. Whitehead has demonstrated the Core Value of Excellence by becoming the heart of
our school. She has stepped up during a time of recent staffing shortages in the front office to provide support and maintain a
positive demeanor, which has positively impacted our entire school community. During a time when demands and stress levels can
be high, Nancy has continued to offer kindness and support to students, staff, and families each day. She has gone above and
beyond every day of this school year, and Olive would not be the most outstanding place to work without her leadership and
commitment to excellence". Mrs. Yamasaki introduced Mrs. Darrow, the principal of Olive Elementary, who joined Nancy tonight.
