Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
the variable term waivers as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: Since July 1994, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) has had the authority to issue
waiver documents relating to educator preparation and credentialing which provide school districts the ability to employ or assign
persons who are not fully credentialed to qualifying assignments. The CCTC has divided the waiver process into two types of
waivers; short-term and variable-term. Short-term waivers give the districts the ability to cover immediate and short-term needs.
This waiver allows employers to assign teachers who hold a basic credential to teach outside of their credential authorization for
one semester or less with the teachers' consent. Variable Term Waivers give school districts the ability to cover assignments
when a fully credentialed employee cannot be found. Waivers allow school districts to meet staffing needs while searching for an
individual who either holds an appropriate credential or qualifies for one of the available assignment options. It also allows the
individuals holding waivers to complete their credential requirements while serving in the classroom.
The certificated employees whose names are listed on the attached have met the requirements, have consented to the
assignment, and have been judged by the site administrator to be competent in the subject matter. Likewise, all other means of
credentialing and reassignment have been explored. The passage of this waiver will allow the District to remain compliant with
SB 435, which requires that all teachers be appropriately assigned.
FISCAL IMPACT: This item has no fiscal impact on the district.

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education adopt
Resolution No. 27-23-24 granting signature authorization

for specific District administrative/leadership employes as
indicated on the attached document.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Authorization of signatures is an item that is routinely updated to reflect personnel changes and to comply with
the requirements of the California Education Code.
As the agency that ultimately releases District payrolls and warrants, the Orange County Department of Education (OCDE) must
maintain on file the approved signature authorizations for all school districts. The signatures are applicable to various documents
that are approved by the Board of Education and in compliance with the Education Code and other pertinent state and federal
laws. The administrative/leadership employees for whom the signature authorizations are designated do not transfer that
authority to any staff members.
Purchase orders are processed within the limitations of existing site/program budgets, with the P.O. listing submitted to the
Board at each meeting. Non-routine expenditures for consultants, contracts, major facility additions, etc. are submitted to the
Board separately for authorization. Before the preparation of a warrant, it is determined that the proper authorization and
approvals exist. Warrants prepared by the District are forwarded to the OCDE for review of documentation, signature, and entry
to OUSDs county ledgers before they are returned to the District for release to vendors, consultants, or contractors. Purchase
orders, bid documents, warrants, payroll, federal/state/county documents, etc. are audited by the Districts independent audit firm.
FISCAL IMPACT:This item has no fiscal impact on the District.
