cases. Specific to telephony, the District can migrate to a Microsoft Teams based phone system rapidly for teachers and publicfacing staff to address public communications while working from home as well as save money long term.
Technology Services can quickly deploy new phone numbers to all teachers and public-facing staff in a few days via the
Microsoft Teams. Staff will be able to call and receive calls from a number of devices, including a work computer, a web browser,
and a phone app. The District will have accounting and visibility to calls conducted by staff members. The total cost for 2055 staff
(teachers, office staff, district departments and leadership) for four months of individual phone service will be $81,730, or $10 per
person per month.
Long term migration to Microsoft Teams Phone Service can provide true Unified Communications between different platforms as
well as physical phones in offices and classrooms. By migrating to Microsoft Teams, the District can save on telephone services
year after year. The fiscal impact would be $110,000 annually yet, there would be a $315,000 Annual Savings.

Teams Phone services at an approximate cost of $110,000 a year.

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve
Cordoba Corporation Amendment No. 4 for the Measure
S Program projects as presented.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION: On April 18, 2019, the Board authorized Cordoba Agreement Amendment No. 3 to provide supplemental
consultant services to coordinate and manage furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E) and move management needed for
Measure S Program projects. Additional services are needed to assist with completion of the large and complex responsibilities
associated with the Measure S Program requirements. Cordoba submitted a proposal for additional services in the amount of
$48,720, inclusive of reimbursable expenses. An additional $4,872 will be added to the contract as a 10% contingency, for a total
authorization of $53,592. Staff and Cumming, Measure S Program Manager, find the proposal to be consistent and reasonable
with current staffing and fees. Costs do not change the overall budget originally planned for the Measure S Program FF&E and
move management services.
Master Agreement Amendment No. 4, will increase the total contract cost from $2,103,540 to $2,157,132.

(RFQP) No. 200130 Construction Management Services for Measure S Program Projects Phase 2, in the Orange County
Register. In addition to the Public Notice, twenty construction management firms were invited to participate and the RFQP
documents were posted electronically to obtain maximum exposure for interested parties. Twenty-one known construction
management firms obtained the RFQP documents.
The District received sealed proposals and fees from six firms, which were opened on March 2, 2020. The proposals and fees
were reviewed and evaluated by the Districts evaluation team utilizing pre-established RFQP evaluation criteria. A shortlist of
three firms were then interviewed by Cabinet also utilizing pre-established RFQP requirements.
Based on the entirety of the evaluation process, inclusive of competitive fees and staffing plans, Executive Cabinet is
recommending to hire the Cordoba Corporation for approval and award of contract for the Measure S Program Phase 2
Construction Management Services.
