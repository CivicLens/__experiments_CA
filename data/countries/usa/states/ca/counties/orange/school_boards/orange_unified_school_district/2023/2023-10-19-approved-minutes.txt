Information, Reports: A. Superintendent's Report
A video on the Attendance Award winners was shown. Superintendent Gonzalez talked about the UC Davis C-STEM distinguished
school award and shared that West Orange Elementary was awarded the prestigious California School Board Association 2023
Golden Bell in the category of Curriculum and Instruction through the California Standards Implementation for their Mathematics
Academy. He also mentioned that Orange Unified students are semifinalists in the 69th annual National Merit Scholarship
Program: Jiya Patel and Alexander Rosu from Canyon High, Michelle Bae from El Modena High, and Jason Trinh from Villa Park
High. Mr. Gonzalez noted that the Local Veterans Administration donated American flags for all classrooms and a big flag for the
front of the Parkside Education Center campus during a ceremony in October. He expressed his thanks to the VA. Mr. Gonzalez
invited the community to the Phase 2 Topping Out ceremony for Villa Park High School's new 36-thousand-square-foot student
services and administration building that will be held later in October. He also thanked the Canyon High School Foundation for
their generous donation of $100,000 towards the renovation of the Canyon High School multipurpose room.
Information, Reports: B. Board President's Report
Public comments:
Alex Brewsaugh, OUSD parent: Since the January 5th meeting, he watched the president's reports. These should be updates on
the district's current state and progress toward goals. Instead, Mr. Ledesma got more political and described his interests and not
those of OUSD. It's illegal to use this time for political statements.
The Board Present requested support from legal counsel to define the content of a president's report. Legal counsel agreed with
the public speaker but stated that the board president can also speak about concerns he has as part of his president's report.
Board President Ledesma stated that it is the profound duty of the Board of Education to protect not only those present in the
meetings but also those within the district school campuses and other affiliated areas under their jurisdiction. He mentioned that
Trustees Page, Erickson, and Yamasaki walked out of the October 7th Board Meeting, and chose not to vote in favor of a Parents
Bill of Rights. He stated that it is important to restore those rights to the parents but that there are individuals who stop at

nothing to ensure that these rights do not proceed. Mr. Ledesma noted that he will not allow this to happen while he serves as
the president of the board.
Information, Reports: C. Board Recognition of Students, Staff and Community
Trustee Yamasaki demanded an apology from the Board President for saying that she, trustees Page, and Erickson support the
Communist Party while her family escaped Communist China, and orchestrated what happened at the September 7th board
meeting. She stated that she did not plan to leave, but felt threatened and unsafe. She noted that she resents that it was said
she orchestrated this. Trustee Yamasaki talked about the great things happening in our school district. She mentioned that she
enjoyed the Trunk and Treat event at Prospect Elementary with a cakewalk, a costume contest, and food, dancing, and music.
She acknowledged the Mid Autumn Festival that the Mandarin Immersion program put together. Ms. Yamasaki also mentioned the
annual Run-a-Thon and a STEAM project at Running Springs Elementary. She thanked the parents for making this possible.
Student Board Member Alex Tran from Villa Park mentioned the strong AP program at Villa Park. He also stated that the OC
Student section recognized Villa Park Black Pack as the Orange County winner for Student Sections. He encouraged everyone to
attend the football games. He also mentioned successful events like Club Rush, Red Ribbon Week, and Homecoming with dance,
karaoke, and games. Mr. Tran recognized the successful annual campus beautification project. Over 100 students spent their
Sunday working on different projects on campus.
Trustee Erickson also mentioned the Trunk or Treat event at Prospect and that she's looking forward to attending events at
other schools as well. She stated that she attended the GOCAT gala, an organization that is raising money to build a theater in
Orange. She noted that she is disgusted and horrified by Mr. Ledesma's rewriting of history. She claimed that last month's
meeting was highly unusual since outside agitators were invited to the meeting and for the first time in history tickets were
issued that our parents and teachers did not know about. This system packed the room with outside agitators, including the
traveling roadshow, which brought havoc and chaos, bullying, and intimidation. Ms. Erickson stated that threats of physical
violence are not acceptable and Mr. Ledesma did nothing. As she has a right to work in a safe environment and nothing was
done, she had to step out. She mentioned that it's nice to see Orange Unified stakeholders back in the room.
Trustee Miner thanked Student Board Member Miss Hoffmann for providing El Modena's School Magazine Frontline. She
mentioned that she visited Serrano, Taft, California, and Yorba. Ms. Miner also mentioned that she organized a Fentanyl town hall
event at Villa Park High School that included OC Supervisor Don Wagner, OC fire authority. OC sheriffs, OC Health, and Villa Park
Councilwoman Crystal Miles. She noted that this was a crucial event for the safety of the community and the students. She
thanked Mr. Angel who reached out to the Orange Police Department and organized a security walkthrough at each school site to
ensure the utmost safety on the campuses. Trustee Miner mentioned that Parental Rights were restored at the last meeting. She
condemned the actions of the three board members who left the meeting due to a disruptive individual who, she believed, did not
pose a physical threat. She learned that staff will present a report in November with strategies for closing the gap in academic
losses.
Trustee Page mentioned that she was one of the 150 participants in a walk-to-school event at Fletcher. She thanked Orange PD
for supporting all the schools that day. She also thanked the new president of the Mandarin Community Booster Club. The
booster club organized the Mid Autumn Festival for the three schools with the Mandarin Immersion Program. Ms. Page noted that
she attended a summit on Disability and Inclusion at Chapman University. Ms. Page mentioned that she also served on the panel
of another conference that was hosted by the Orange County Readers Association where the theme was research-based
approaches to literacy and reading instruction with many of our district teachers and students attending. Ms. Page invited Mr.
Ledesma to join her in future events so they can focus on the district and be able to share more news on our students.
Trustee Rusmey thanked Mr. Gonzalez for his attendance award report. She congratulated West Orange Elementary on
receiving the Golden Bell Award. Ms. Rumsey welcomed student board members and enjoyed the agenda prep meeting she and
Ms. Page held. She noted that we all have the right to express our position and the position of our constituents and that we need
to fight for that while focusing on education and creating a healthy environment for all learners. She stated that the board needs
to be able to run the meeting and that they need to be professional.
Trustee Ortega thanked the staff for coordinating the board meetings. He also thanked Orange PD for being here. He stated
that the outburst from the communist group was not appropriate. He noted that he has a lot of training in law enforcement, and
when the three board members walked out, he did not feel unsafe at all. He claimed that reflections need to be made as all kinds
of accusations are made about individuals but at the same time the board president gets cursed out and trustee Miner is being
followed home.
Student Board Member Nancy Albeno from Orange High School shared all the wonderful events that happened at her school.
She mentioned the Feeder School Night at one of the football games shining a highlight to breast cancer awareness, the annual
college career fair, and the Love Orange kick-off event. She also mentioned that the school hosted a tour for the class of 1953,
celebrating their 50th reunion and that she enjoyed her homecoming dance with a 'Dancing through the Decades' theme.
Student Board Member Emma Hoffmann from El Modena High School Emma mentioned that Women's League will host their
annual Walk for the Cure which raises money and awareness for breast cancer. She stated that at the Mama Mia-themed
homecoming dance, ASB honored Ryder Wade, an ASB student who passed away a couple of years back. She gave a shout-out to
the flag football team that just wrapped up their season. She also mentioned the Coffee Night that will be held on campus which
is a show for those with special skills like singing and dancing, that the Girls Golf Team is doing well with two girls in the league
finals, and that the Annual Blood Drive was held on campus. Ms. Hoffmann stated Voter registration is also taking place on
campus and that Dancing with the Teachers, put on by the Vanguard Dance Company, will be held next month. She also
addressed the public comments that were made. She left the last board meeting because she did feel unsafe. She stated that the
fact that she needs security guards is sad. She also presented at the City Council meeting without security and it's upsetting to
her that that is not possible here. She mentioned that a Student Bill of Rights is in the works.
Student Board Member Jiya Patel from Canyon High School mentioned that their 50th anniversary Homecoming Dance sold a
school record in tickets. She stated that girls' volleyball and girls' golf are both League Champions.
Trustee Yamasaki shared her disappointment that fellow trustees felt the need to diminish how board members felt and not
acknowledge that they felt that their safety was compromised.
Information: D. School Spotlight: Jiya Patel - Canyon High School
Trustee Ledesma introduced Canyon High School student Jiya Patel. Jiya was accompanied by her ASB Class, ambassadors,
Acting Principal McKee, and Activities Director Steve Smith. Jiya highlighted the Ambassador Program at Canyon High School as a
unique and special program. The program is aimed to promote excitement, camaraderie, and school spirit on campus, especially
to the entering freshman class. There are around 200 upperclassmen who are accepted as ambassadors, and at the beginning of
each year, they are paired with a group of around eight freshmen. Ambassadors undergo training beforehand, and during
Freshman Orientation Day, they bond with their group of freshmen, playing games, sharing snacks, and encouraging their groups

to find their niche in some of the many clubs, sports, and extracurriculars that are available at Canyon. The Freshmen can rely on
their ambassador for advice or support. Ambassadors also sign up to volunteer at school events like Back-to-School night or
Open Houses, and they arrive early to home football games, following the Canyon tradition of running the football field before
every home game and spreading infectious spirit and enthusiasm to the students.
Information: E. Board Recognition - "YOU'VE GOT THE EDGE" - Employee of the Month Recognition Program
Acting Assistant Superintendent Human Resources Ms. Tracy Knibb presented the item.
This month Lilyanne Werner, Teacher at Villa Park High School, and Fernando Orozco-Cortes, Custodian at Orange High School
were recognized. Principal Dennis Mc Cuistion had this to say about Lilyanne: “Lilyanne Werner is a highly valued teacher at Villa
Park High School. She wears many hats on campus beyond teaching math and services the students with nothing but positivity
and commitment. Her integrity shows in her efforts to support and continue to grow the AVID program and in her daily
interactions with students, families, and colleagues. She consistently goes out of her way to be a cheerleader for student success.
Villa Park High School is fortunate to have Lilyanne as part of the Spartan family!” Orange High School Principal Sheryl Anderson
had this to say about Fernando: “Fernando is committed and dedicated to his work day in and day out. He is always respectful to
students and staff and goes above and beyond to meet their needs and expectations. Fernando takes great pride in his work and
is a quiet leader. The students and staff know that they can count on Fernando and his high-quality work and dedication help
make Orange a safe and clean environment we are all our proud of. Orange High School is honored to have Fernando
representing as a Panther!
Information: F. International "Walk to School Month"
Executive Director Student & Community Services Heriberto Angel presented the item. He shared that OUSD participated in the
Walk to School Day on October 4th, 2023 because:
• It is fun! Starting your school day with a walk is an opportunity for students and families to begin the day with enthusiasm.
Walk to School Day also builds connections between students, families, and their environment.
• It encourages safety. It's an opportunity to teach and reinforce safe walking behavior while bonding as a family.
• It promotes physical activity. Starting the school day with a walk is one of the easiest ways to get daily physical activity that
kids need to be healthy.
• It is good for learning. Research shows that walking helps overall learning. Students start the school day alert and ready to
learn.
• It helps reduce traffic congestion. More kids on foot with their families means fewer cars on the road. Fewer cars on the road
results in less traffic congestion around the school zone and neighborhood.
5. APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Action: A. Approval of minutes from the August 17, 2023 meeting
It is recommended that the Board of Education approve the minutes as presented and reviewed.
Motion by Kris Erickson, second by Angie Rumsey.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Kris Erickson, Ana Page, Rick Ledesma, John Ortega, Angie Rumsey, Madison Miner
Not Present at Vote: Andrea Yamasaki
Action: B. Approval of minutes from the September 7, 2023 meeting
During a discussion, Trustee Erickson stated that the minutes on item 7A are inaccurate as this was not what happened during
the meeting. She noted that minutes serve as an official record and a historical document of what happened at the meetings and
require accuracy of the board's actions and since one of the items on the agenda tonight is to hire a law firm that might have to
defend the policy that was passed last month, the minutes need to reflect what happened. She mentioned that minutes
incorrectly document the motion that was made for the policy and even contain a false characterization of the motion. She
continued by saying that the minutes failed to include the major altercation and clash that preceded the vote that caused her,
and trustees Yamasaki and Page to leave out of fear for their physical safety. She asked that the existing footage of the meeting
be preserved and that footage taken by trustee Ortega be turned over. She noted that Trustee Miner made a motion, Trustee
Rumsey seconds, and all are in favor but she is wondering what passed since the words 'I make a motion' mean nothing. She
stated that since the district may get sued over this policy, the minutes need to be correct and should include the riot since that's
the reason they left. Legal counsel clarified that the motion was clear and that staff was clear on what was approved.
It is recommended that the Board of Education approve the minutes as presented and reviewed.
Motion by John Ortega, second by Madison Miner.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Rick Ledesma, John Ortega, Angie Rumsey, Madison Miner
Abstain: Andrea Yamasaki, Kris Erickson, Ana Page
6. PUBLIC COMMENT
Procedural: A. Public Comment
7. ACTION ITEMS
Action: A. AGREEMENT FOR LEGAL LITIGATION SERVICES WITH THE LIBERTY JUSTICE CENTER
Public comments:
Jolin, OUSD parent: Do not do what lands you in this situation in the first place. Just follow the laws and do right by our students.
Soren Williams, OUSD parent: Why does our board think they need free legal advice? You need to follow the money. The Board
majority is funded by outside interest groups. These groups have a few goals: go after teacher unions and LGBTQ students. All
policies are crafted by those outside groups. These policies don't help our students and only raise fear.
Gregory Pleasants, OUSD parent: Our students are used as a test case by this group. They bought the board majority and they
want to use our students to be their test case. The policy is indefensible. It's going to violate the law. It's going to create a

climate of fear. Parenting is not easy. Why would you want a report to tell them who they are if you love them so much?
Jon Sanks, OUSD parent: What will happen if the attorney will not be able to find the funds mentioned in the agreement? Even if
it's free, bad legal work is a bad deal. Run functional schools, don't pick fights with the government.
Florita, OUSD parent: The recall effort is continuing to obstruct the district for the last 10 months. She supports the item.
Alex Brewsaugh, OUSD parent: Why does this board expect to get sued? No description in the motion of what is being moved.
Accepting free legal services but what are you accepting?
Stephanie Camacho-Van Dyke: Director of Advocacy and Education at the LGBTQ Center OC, is appalled by the actions of the
board majority in approving the Parent Notification Policy, but also what happened throughout the last meeting. The ticketing
system locked out parents and teachers and let outside agitators in. Students, Staff, and parents deserve better.
Legal Counsel John Raicic presented the item. Some questions were answered.
It is recommended by the District's Legal Counsel that the District Governing Board approve the Attorney Engagement
Agreement for litigation services between the Orange Unified School District Board of Education and Liberty Justice Center so that
an agreement is in place in the event the State initiates litigation against OUSD.
Motion by Angie Rumsey, second by John Ortega.
There is a discussion. At 10:00 p.m. Angie Rumsey called for the question. Motion passes 4 - 3 straight to vote.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Rick Ledesma, John Ortega, Angie Rumsey, Madison Miner
Nay: Andrea Yamasaki, Kris Erickson, Ana Page
Action: B. PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO BOARD POLICY 5020.1 PARENTAL RIGHTS
At 10:04 p.m. Madison Miner made a motion to extend the meeting until 1 a.m. John Ortega seconds. All in favor.
Public comments:
Jolin Lang, OUSD parent: The board claims to do this to protect the kids, but so far, it's only protecting parental ownership. We
want to raise productive members of society. Now we say the parents have all the rights and the kids have none. We need to give
children a good education.
Gregory Pleasants, OUSD parent: This is all for a small, loud, group that bought their students. This is not for students, not for
him, and not for the thousands of parents. This is for the selfish, extremist, right-wing ends. He denounces it.
Stephanie Bezuidenhout, OUSD parent: Amendments do apply to parent's rights. She has the right to make sure her child has
access to a diverse library at school. It should be a no-brainer that you follow the law. It's not optional.
Kim Flint, OUSD parent: She had a positive experience watching parental rights being restored in the community. She commends
Miner and Ledesma for restoring parental rights and restoring faith in the district by firing the superintendent.
Crystal Miles: There should not be an amendment. The policy was adopted. An Amendment sets a bad precedent.
Patty Cabada: Don't add to the policy. We have to have control over what is on the bookshelf.
Yolanda: Why do you want to take away the rights of parents? You are trying to indoctrinate our children. Listen to the rights of
the parents.
Dulce: Defend the rights of parents. She is here to support the parent's rights.
Rachel Ruiz: Who gets to add after you already voted for a policy? Don't change it.
Florita, OUSD parent: Children are under the care of parents. Don't move forward with these changes. Write a separate bill of
rights for students.
Linda May: Supports any amendments that make the policy more humane for students. Also, listen to your constituents. She has
been paying property taxes for 30 years without having children in the district. Don't marginalize gay kids and makeup stories
about transgender stuff.
Rosa Otero: Parental rights have already been upheld by the US Constitution.
Cecilia I: Founder and member of the Union of Parents. Don't vote for the policy. Ms. Erickson is a racist.
Louise Salamon: The vote was made. Don't change.
Trustee Erickson explained why she brought the policy back. She stated that this is not the policy that was voted on last month,
but a policy that was brought up in June and that is promoting parent's rights. She noted that in June, it was added to the
agenda outside the process and only received one reading. She stated that she asked to amend the policy, but Mr. Ledesma
wanted her to bring back the policy at a later meeting.
Motion by Madison Miner to approve policy except for the first bullet point as mentioned in the description of the agenda
item: The District will provide all students with equitable access to a full library of age-appropriate books to satisfy the diverse
needs and interests of all types of students, and the District will protect the First Amendment rights of all students. Trustee Miner
stated that she would like to see this section reworded.
Second by Rick Ledesma.
During a discussion, Trustee Page stated that all students deserve access to information. If we want the students to be literate
readers, they need to have access to books to become that reader. She stated that students need to see themselves in the
books.
Trustee Miner stated that she would like the language to be reworded. Trustee Ledesma wondered who defines what ageappropriate is. He stated that he wants something about parent approval in the policy. Trustee Rusmey noted that she is willing
to contribute to rewording the paragraph.
Yea: Rick Ledesma, John Ortega, Angie Rumsey, Madison Miner
Nay: Andrea Yamasaki, Kris Erickson, Ana Page
Motion Carries 4 - 3
Angie Rusmey made a motion to accept the rest of the changes to the Board Policy as mentioned in the description of the agenda
item, second by Ana Page.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Andrea Yamasaki, Kris Erickson, Ana Page, Rick Ledesma, John Ortega, Angie Rumsey, Madison Miner

Action: C. PROPOSED REVISIONS TO BOARD POLICIES AND BYLAWS SECOND READING AND APPROVAL
There was a discussion on Board Policy 5145.6. Mr. Gonzalez stated that changes in board policies come from changes in the law
or recommendations by CSBA.
Trustee Page questioned Board Policy 5148. She requested to remove the strikeout on CDE so that the entire sentence reads: the
Board shall enter into a contract with the California Department of Social Services and the Department of Education. Executive
Director Ms. Rodriguez confirmed that she will add the CDE back into the policy.
It is recommended that the Board of Education receive the proposed Board Policy revision for a second reading and approval
including the changes in BP 5148.
Motion by Madison Miner, second by Kris Erickson.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Andrea Yamasaki, Kris Erickson, Ana Page, Rick Ledesma, John Ortega, Angie Rumsey, Madison Miner
Action: D. APPROVAL OF EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT FOR SUPERINTENDENT
Public comments:
Rosa Otero: The board has offered the position and he has accepted. She is happy to have Mr. Gonzalez and she supports him.
Lorrie Kaylor: Good things have happened this year. Thanks for putting students before the union.
It is recommended the Board of Education approve the Employment Agreement for Superintendent between the Board of
Education of the Orange Unified School District and Mr. Ernest Gonzalez, commencing September 7, 2023.

8. INFORMATION / DISCUSSION ITEMS
Information: A. CLASSROOM UTILIZATION REPORT
Deputy Superintendent Mr. Rivera presented the item. Some questions were answered.
Information: B. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Public comment:
Michelle Weisenberg: 20 schools are over 50 years old and they have never been modernized. None of these schools have been
prioritized by Trustees Ledesma and Ortega who have been on the board for the last 22 years. There is money but that will go
elsewhere.
Deputy Superintendent Mr. Rivera and Mr. Holash from MGT presented the item. Some questions were answered.
There was a suggestion to hold a study session to share ideas and discuss maintenance before or shortly after the next board
meeting.
Information: C. VILLA PARK HIGH SCHOOL POOL PRESENTATION (PBK ARCHITECTS)
Public comments:
Jenny Sloan, OUSD parent: There is so much to do and we just want to buy a pool? There are schools without AC or Heat and we
want to build a pool for 100 kids.
JJ Meiss, OUSD parent: He is excited about a new pool but deplores the political stink. The chaos is continuing to drive goodquality people from the district.
Nicol Jones, OUSD parent: Villa Park pool is old and breaking. It needs to be put at the top of the list. It is just an information
item and it concerns her. It needs to be an action item.
Eddie Kim: The board majority's commitment is to all students and they will find a solution for the pool.
Kim Flint, OUSD parent: The recall people tell lies about the pool.
Lorrie Kaylor: Why do people say that Trustee Ortega has a conflict of interest? There is no conflict of interest. Pool is overdue.
Stop the delays.
Darshan Smaaladen, OUSD parent: The school buildings have not been retrofitted for earthquakes and you're going to build a
pool?
Alex Brewsaugh, OUSD parent: Facilities reserves are reflected in the budget that you can find online. The cheapest option for a
new pool is 21 million plus fees. That leaves a little over 3 million in reserves.
Louise Salamon: There are options with 100 million in real estate. With proper management, you can have everything. Kids
deserve a safe/new pool.
Rosa Otero: We should look at the properties and see what can be sold. Measure S could have been spread out a bit more. ACs
must be prioritized, but also a safe pool. A good pool facility can bring money in.
Deputy Superintendent Mr. Rivera, Mr. Lavey from PBK Architects, and Mr. Yeoman from Parker & Covert presented the item.
Some questions were answered.
At 1:00 am Rick Ledesma made a motion to extend the meeting until 1:45 a.m. Kris Erickson seconds. All in favor.

Public comment:
Alex Brewsaugh, OUSD parent: Ortega should recuse himself from this item. His daughter swims for ORCA. Orca rents pool space
from Villa Park HS. He refuses to answer questions. There was a mailer from ORCA stating that a vote for Miner and Ledesma is a
vote for a 50-meter pool. They also pay lower non-profit rental rates.

It is recommended that the Board of Education approve the item as presented.
Motion by John Ortega, second by Angie Rumsey.
During a discussion, Trustee Erickson mentioned that there needs to be more discussion about the size. Trustee
Yamasaki suggested holding a town hall to discuss the pool with the community, especially since this will create a
parking problem in the neighborhood.

Public comment:

Trustee Yamasaki explained that she pulled the item because she wants to make sure that everyone knows what they will be
paying. No more deals with board members. There also needs to be an investigation into ORCA.

17. PUBLIC COMMENT
Procedural: A. Public Comment
Jolin, OUSD parent: She was terrified at the last meeting. A commotion broke out and she did not feel safe. She hopes to never
be in that situation again.
Gregory Pleasants, OUSD parent: Thanked the teachers in our district. They have suffered through the politics. He also thanked
administrators. His kids are thriving.
Dan R, OUSD parent: He emailed the board and did not hear back from the board members who say they are for parents' rights.
He supports the recall.
Jon Sanks, OUSD parent: We should not have the Canyon High School students wait so long. He is frustrated by last month's
meeting as there was a ticket system he did not know about and a different policy than attached to the agenda was discussed.
Florita Sheldon, OUSD parent: She met with Mrs. Green about the curriculum. She wants information about detransitioning added
to the curriculum.
Patty Cabada: She was offended by the comments Erickson made about the last meeting.
Linda May: Groups of people that are talking about communists and queers will tell you that kindergarten kids are reading
pornography. They read from the same scripts over and over again. These are all lies.
Alex Brewsaugh, OUSD parent: There is a great turnover in staff, last the director of maintenance and the director of facilities.
They work for the good of our district. He wished Tony and Scott good luck since the board didn't say anything.
Louise Salomon: AB665 Kids can be taken away from parents. The recall is despicable.
