Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education adopt
Resolution 14-23-24: Findings Pertaining to Developer
Fees and approve the Combined Annual and Five-Year
Developer Fee Report.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Government Code Sections 66001 and 66006 require local agencies, including school districts, to report
ondeveloper fees that are collected and expended on both an annual and five-year basis.
The annual report focuses on the amount of developer fees collected by theDistrict and expended throughout the fiscal year. The
five-year report requires a more detailed analysis of the Districts overall use of developer fees. It is more efficientfor a school
districtto prepare a comprehensive report each fiscal year that includes both the annual and five-year collection and expenditure
information. By combining these two reports, there is securityagainst apotential penalty of refunding unexpended developer fees
for failure to timely report expenditures in the appropriate year.
Although not required by a resolution, the report findings are often made in the form of a resolution that is adopted by the
governing board to facilitate compliance with the requisite codes and regulations.
The annual report must be made within 180 days from the last day of the fiscal year. The five-year findings must be presented
for approval by the Governing Board in conjunction with an annual report. The completed reports and applicable findings must be
available for public review at least 15 days prior to approval by the governing board. A notice was posted on the District website
and the information has been available since November 29, 2023.

The following Change Order lists a general descriptive summary of the work, the cost increase or decrease (if any) to the
contract, and its impact on the contract time. In this instance, the only effect is an increase in the contract time which was
reviewed and found to be reasonable by the Cumming Program Management Team, the onsite Construction Management
Team, Architect, and Facilities staff.

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education adopt
Resolution No. 15-23-24 granting signature authorization
for specific District administrative/leadership employes as
indicated on the attached document.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Authorization of signatures is an item that is routinely updated to reflect changes in personnel and to comply with
the requirements of the California Education Code.
As the agency that ultimately releases District payrolls and warrants, the Orange County Department of Education (OCDE) must
maintain on file the approved signature authorizations for all school districts. The signatures are applicable to various documents
that are approved by the Board of Education and in compliance with the Education Code and other pertinent state and federal
laws. The administrative/leadership employees for whom the signature authorizations are designated do not transfer that
authority to any staff members.
Purchase orders are processed within the limitations of existing site/program budgets, with the P.O. listing submitted to the
Board at each meeting. Non-routine expenditures for consultants, contracts, major facility additions, etc. are submitted to the
Board separately for authorization. Before the preparation of a warrant, it is determined that the proper authorization and
approvals exist. Warrants prepared by the District are forwarded to the OCDE for review of documentation, signature, and entry
to OUSDs county ledgers before they are returned to the District for release to vendors, consultants, or contractors. Purchase
orders, bid documents, warrants, payroll, federal/state/county documents, etc. are audited by the Districts independent audit firm.
FISCAL IMPACT:This item has no fiscal impact on the District.
