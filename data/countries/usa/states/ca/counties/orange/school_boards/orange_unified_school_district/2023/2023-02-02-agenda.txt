For the significant role played by Jeanne Carter in
establishing and maintaining the El Modena High School
Nature Center over the past 50 years which has served over
50,000 students on field trips, it is recommended that the
Board of Education name the El Modena High School Nature
Center in honor of Jeanne Carter and establish a date for the
naming ceremony at the Nature Center.

DESCRIPTION: In 1972, the El Modena High School Nature Center (Nature Center) was established by El Modena High School
Chemistry Teacher Jeanne Carter and she has been its driving force since its inception. The Nature Center is dedicated to the
teaching of water conservation and ecological principles to all students and to community members.
The Nature Centeroccupies approximately one acre with a large pond, a 200-foot stream with wetland areas and over 100
different native California plants. The Nature Center has served and educated over 50,000 students through high school studentled tours developed by Ms. Carter who continues today to build strong partnerships with community organizations such as the
Orange Rotary Club, Love Orange, Circle K (Kiwanis) from California State University, Fullerton and the Boy Scouts to support
the flourishing of the Nature Center. Today, the Nature Center continues to provide a significant hands-on learning science
environment for students and community members.
On June 2, 2022, the Board of Education issued a proclamation for the El Modena High School Nature Center's 50thAnniversary
acknowledging Ms. Carter and the significant role she has played in developing and maintaining the Nature Center. Her active
participation still continues even though she has been retired for 20 years.
Board Policy 7310 lists a specific protocol for the naming of schools, but indicates that [a]t the discretion of the Board, buildings
rooms, property, playing fields and equipment of the Orange Unified School District may be assigned names that designate
certain geographical locations or areas, commemorate historical events, or those which have special significance for the
community, or commemorate an individual or groups of individuals who have made civic, educational, or cultural contributions or
who have brought special recognition to the school system through service, prominence or heroism.
In accordance with the Proclamation of the Board for the significant role played by Jeanne Carter in establishing and maintaining
the El Modena High School Nature Center these past 50 years and consistent with Board policy and District practice, it is
recommended that the Board of Education name the El Modena High School Nature Center in honor of Jeanne Carter and
establish a date for the naming ceremony at the Nature Center.

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Education adopt
Resolution No. 21-22-23 granting signature authorization
for specific District administrative/leadership employes as
indicated on the attached document.

Public Content
DESCRIPTION:Authorization of signatures is an item that is routinely updated to reflect changes in personnel and to comply with
the requirements of the California Education Code.
As the agency which ultimately releases District payrolls and warrants, the Orange County Department of Education (OCDE)
must maintain on file the approved signature authorizations for all school districts. The signatures are applicable to various
documents which are approved by the Board of Education and in compliance with the Education Code and other pertinent state
and federal laws. The administrative/leadership employees for whom the signature authorizations are designated do not transfer
that authority to any staff members.
Purchase orders are processed within the limitations of existing site/program budgets, with the P.O. listing submitted to the
Board at each meeting. Non-routine expenditures for consultants, contracts, major facility additions, etc. are submitted to the
Board separately for authorization. Before the preparation of a warrant, it is determined that the proper authorization and
approvals exist. Warrants prepared by the District are forwarded to the OCDE for review of documentation, signature, and entry
to OUSDs county ledgers before they are returned to the District for release to vendors, consultants, or contractors. Purchase
orders, bid documents, warrants, payroll, federal/state/county documents, etc. are audited by the Districts independent audit firm.
FISCAL IMPACT:This item has no fiscal impact.
