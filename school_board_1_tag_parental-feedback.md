## 2023-01-05 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The special board meeting held on January 5, 2023, was convened to address significant administrative changes within the district. The meeting, which was called to order by Board President Rick Ledesma, faced scrutiny from some board members and the public regarding its timing during the winter break and the lack of prior notice to Superintendent Dr. Hansen and Assistant Superintendent Mrs. Corella. Despite a motion by Andrea Yamasaki to postpone the meeting, the motion failed with a split vote among the board members.

The board decided to terminate the contract of Superintendent Dr. Hansen with a 30-day notice and placed her on paid administrative leave. Similarly, Assistant Superintendent Mrs. Corella was placed on administrative leave pending a curriculum and educational audit. These decisions were met with opposition from several board members, including Andrea Yamasaki and Kris Erickson, and sparked extensive public comments mostly opposing the terminations. 

In response to these administrative changes, the board appointed Edward Velasquez as the Interim Superintendent and Craig Abercrombie as the Acting Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services, both effective January 9, 2023. The meeting highlighted issues related to school-board ethics, policy changes, community engagement, and parental feedback, as evidenced by the public's strong reaction to the board's decisions and the procedural concerns raised during the meeting.
