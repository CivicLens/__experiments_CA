## 2023-08-17 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The regular board meeting held on August 17, 2023, addressed several significant topics, including the appointment of Mr. Gonzalez as Superintendent and Monica Luther as a Middle School Principal, both approved with a 6-0-1 vote due to Trustee Page's absence. A major point of discussion was the proposed Board Policy regarding Parent/Guardian Notification, which was prepared by Board President Ledesma and Trustee Miner with legal counsel. This policy has sparked a debate on parental rights versus student privacy, particularly concerning the notification of parents about transgender and non-binary students. Trustee Erickson and Yamasaki expressed concerns about potential discrimination and legal implications, while Trustee Miner argued for the policy's legality and importance for parental rights. The policy is undergoing its first reading, with suggestions for revisions being considered.

Community engagement was evident with numerous public comments both supporting and opposing the proposed notification policy. Some community members expressed concerns about the potential outing of transgender students and the possible negative impact on student safety and teacher roles. Trustee Rumsey raised questions about the repercussions for teachers who do not comply with the policy, reflecting broader concerns about teacher support and the potential impact on teacher-staff shortages.

Additionally, the board discussed several policy changes and resolutions, including revisions to Board Policies and Bylaws, and resolutions related to the Public Employees Medical and Hospital Care Act. The meeting also covered community contributions, such as the Orange Unified Public Schools Foundation's donation for musical instruments and the Friendly Center's backpack supply drive. The meeting concluded with public comments on non-agenda items, highlighting ongoing community concerns about student welfare and parental involvement in education.
