## 2023-06-20 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Special Board Meeting held on June 20, 2023, addressed several key issues, including the adoption of a Parent/Guardian Bill of Rights. The policy, which was eventually adopted, aims to consolidate existing rights into a single document, with some trustees arguing it was redundant while others supported its necessity for clarity and accessibility. Additional rights were suggested, including ensuring equitable access to a full library of age-appropriate books and providing advocacy opportunities for parents in their native language. The policy faced opposition, with concerns about political motivations and redundancy with existing policies.

The board also discussed a policy limiting the display of flags on district/school flagpoles to only the United States and California flags. This policy change was met with mixed reactions from the public, with some viewing it as an unnecessary move that could foster division, while others supported it as a unifying measure. Legal counsel confirmed that the change was primarily a rephrasing of existing regulations.

In terms of special education, a public hearing was held regarding the Orange Unified Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA). The board approved the SELPA Local Plan, with public comments emphasizing the need for enhanced student safety measures, such as metal detectors. Additionally, discussions on school safety and facility improvements were highlighted, with concerns raised about resource allocation and the need for competitive bidding processes.

## 2023-01-05 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The special board meeting held on January 5, 2023, was convened to address significant administrative changes within the district. The meeting, which was called to order by Board President Rick Ledesma, faced scrutiny from some board members and the public regarding its timing during the winter break and the lack of prior notice to Superintendent Dr. Hansen and Assistant Superintendent Mrs. Corella. Despite a motion by Andrea Yamasaki to postpone the meeting, the motion failed with a split vote among the board members.

The board decided to terminate the contract of Superintendent Dr. Hansen with a 30-day notice and placed her on paid administrative leave. Similarly, Assistant Superintendent Mrs. Corella was placed on administrative leave pending a curriculum and educational audit. These decisions were met with opposition from several board members, including Andrea Yamasaki and Kris Erickson, and sparked extensive public comments mostly opposing the terminations. 

In response to these administrative changes, the board appointed Edward Velasquez as the Interim Superintendent and Craig Abercrombie as the Acting Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services, both effective January 9, 2023. The meeting highlighted issues related to school-board ethics, policy changes, community engagement, and parental feedback, as evidenced by the public's strong reaction to the board's decisions and the procedural concerns raised during the meeting.
