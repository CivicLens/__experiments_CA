The Special Board Meeting held on March 3, 2020, focused on the Facilities Master Plan, a key component of the district's long-term strategic plans. The meeting included a presentation by the LPA team, which highlighted the importance of having a Facilities Master Plan as the first step in the facilities improvement process. The plan is recommended every 3-5 years by the California Department of Education and is required for state funding through Prop 13 SFP. The presentation emphasized the need for data-driven decision-making and aligning facilities with the educational program vision and LCAP goals.

Community engagement played a significant role in developing the Facilities Master Plan, with input gathered from various stakeholders, including an Executive Steering Committee, Facilities Master Plan Committee, Curriculum Council, focus groups, and online surveys. The plan addresses several themes, such as realistic financial planning, surplus property management, and stakeholder confidence in decision-making. Specific areas of focus included shared facilities, expanded learning opportunities, accessibility, safety, and updated classroom environments.

The board also discussed challenges such as aging infrastructure, declining enrollment, and competition with other districts and private schools. Opportunities identified included the potential for magnet schools and joint-use sites. The meeting concluded with discussions on the inclusion of K-8 schools in the plan and exploring joint-use and funding sources with the city of Orange.

## 2020-01-16 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The regular board meeting held on January 16, 2020, involved several key discussions and decisions relevant to the Orange Unified School District. The meeting began with a closed session focused on various personnel and property issues, including a midyear progress review for the Superintendent and discussions on labor negotiations and anticipated litigation.

The board also addressed policy changes and community engagement through discussions on upcoming changes in voting procedures and the importance of Proposition 13 of 2020, which could impact school funding through matching grants. Additionally, the board acknowledged the contributions of Dr. Elsie Briseno-Simonovski, the departing principal of Richland Continuation High School, highlighting her role in the school's recognition as a Model Continuation School.

The meeting also covered special education support, with consent items related to special education students and attorney fee settlements being approved. Parental feedback was encouraged, particularly regarding the new voting procedures and Proposition 13, which were seen as significant for the district's future funding and strategic planning. The board concluded with a public comment session and a discussion on the need for resolutions supporting Proposition 13 due to its potential financial benefits for the district. The meeting adjourned at 9:50 pm.
