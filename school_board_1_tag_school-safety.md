The meeting also addressed school safety concerns, particularly following a previous board meeting where disruptions led to some members walking out. There were discussions about the need for security at meetings and on school campuses.

## 2023-09-07 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The regular board meeting on September 7, 2023, included significant discussions and decisions on various policies and community issues. A key focus was the proposed board policy regarding parent/guardian notification, which was subject to a second reading and approval. This policy, which garnered both support and opposition from the public, emphasizes parental rights and student privacy.

Community engagement was evident through multiple public comments, with individuals expressing strong opinions on both sides of the parental notification policy. The board also handled various administrative matters, including the approval of unaudited financial reports, textbook sufficiency, and amendments to existing resolutions related to the California Schools Healthy Air, Plumbing and Efficiency Program.

## 2023-06-20 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Special Board Meeting held on June 20, 2023, addressed several key issues, including the adoption of a Parent/Guardian Bill of Rights. The policy, which was eventually adopted, aims to consolidate existing rights into a single document, with some trustees arguing it was redundant while others supported its necessity for clarity and accessibility. Additional rights were suggested, including ensuring equitable access to a full library of age-appropriate books and providing advocacy opportunities for parents in their native language. The policy faced opposition, with concerns about political motivations and redundancy with existing policies.

The board also discussed a policy limiting the display of flags on district/school flagpoles to only the United States and California flags. This policy change was met with mixed reactions from the public, with some viewing it as an unnecessary move that could foster division, while others supported it as a unifying measure. Legal counsel confirmed that the change was primarily a rephrasing of existing regulations.

In terms of special education, a public hearing was held regarding the Orange Unified Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA). The board approved the SELPA Local Plan, with public comments emphasizing the need for enhanced student safety measures, such as metal detectors. Additionally, discussions on school safety and facility improvements were highlighted, with concerns raised about resource allocation and the need for competitive bidding processes.
