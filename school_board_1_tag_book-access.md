## 2023-10-19 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The regular board meeting on October 19, 2023, discussed several key issues, including parental rights, student privacy, and book access.

## 2023-06-20 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Special Board Meeting held on June 20, 2023, addressed several key issues, including the adoption of a Parent/Guardian Bill of Rights. The policy, which was eventually adopted, aims to consolidate existing rights into a single document, with some trustees arguing it was redundant while others supported its necessity for clarity and accessibility. Additional rights were suggested, including ensuring equitable access to a full library of age-appropriate books and providing advocacy opportunities for parents in their native language. The policy faced opposition, with concerns about political motivations and redundancy with existing policies.

The board also discussed a policy limiting the display of flags on district/school flagpoles to only the United States and California flags. This policy change was met with mixed reactions from the public, with some viewing it as an unnecessary move that could foster division, while others supported it as a unifying measure. Legal counsel confirmed that the change was primarily a rephrasing of existing regulations.

In terms of special education, a public hearing was held regarding the Orange Unified Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA). The board approved the SELPA Local Plan, with public comments emphasizing the need for enhanced student safety measures, such as metal detectors. Additionally, discussions on school safety and facility improvements were highlighted, with concerns raised about resource allocation and the need for competitive bidding processes.
