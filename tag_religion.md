## 2020-05-07 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The virtual school board meeting held on May 7, 2020, addressed several key issues and updates within the Orange Unified School District. Due to the virtual nature of the meeting, all votes were conducted as roll call votes. The meeting began with the establishment of a quorum and adjournment to a closed session to discuss legal and property matters. During the regular session, Dr. Hansen reported on the board's decision to delegate authority to settle workers' compensation claims, which was unanimously approved. 

Key highlights included the recognition of McPherson Magnet School as a "Project Lead the Way" Distinguished School and the success of students in the PTA Reflections Competition. The board acknowledged the challenges and successes of implementing distance learning due to COVID-19, commending the IT department, teachers, and staff for their efforts. Special Education support was also highlighted, with board members expressing appreciation for the resources provided to special education students during remote learning.

Policy changes were discussed, including the approval of various contracts and amendments related to the Measure S Program and classroom furnishings. The board also addressed membership in associations, deciding to table the decision on California School Boards Association membership until the next meeting for further discussion. Additionally, the board recognized the National Day of Prayer, reflecting on the community's efforts to find solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic.
