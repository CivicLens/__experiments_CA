## 2024-02-08 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Agenda)

The Orange Unified School District held a Regular Board Meeting on February 8, 2024, where several key actions and resolutions were discussed. Notably, the board adopted Resolution No. 16-23-24, which authorized a sole source contract with A&TS.p.A./Myrtha Pools, USA for the acquisition of Myrtha pool products in connection with the Villa Park High School Aquatic Center Project, with an amount not to exceed $1,100,000. This decision was based on the determination that A&TS.p.A. is the only authorized reseller in the United States for Myrtha products, allowing the district to bypass competitive bidding.

Additionally, the board approved various funding requests for special education services, including expenses related to students with exceptional needs, totaling up to $20,000 for one case and $50,000 for another. The meeting also included a Memorandum of Understanding with Maryville University for the placement of clinical student teachers in physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology, effective from February 9, 2024, through February 8, 2028, which aims to enhance community engagement and support for special education initiatives.

## 2023-09-07 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The regular board meeting on September 7, 2023, included significant discussions and decisions on various policies and community issues. A key focus was the proposed board policy regarding parent/guardian notification, which was subject to a second reading and approval. This policy, which garnered both support and opposition from the public, emphasizes parental rights and student privacy.

The Special Board Meeting held on June 20, 2023, addressed several key issues, including the adoption of a Parent/Guardian Bill of Rights. The policy, which was eventually adopted, aims to consolidate existing rights into a single document, with some trustees arguing it was redundant while others supported its necessity for clarity and accessibility. Additional rights were suggested, including ensuring equitable access to a full library of age-appropriate books and providing advocacy opportunities for parents in their native language. The policy faced opposition, with concerns about political motivations and redundancy with existing policies.

The board also discussed a policy limiting the display of flags on district/school flagpoles to only the United States and California flags. This policy change was met with mixed reactions from the public, with some viewing it as an unnecessary move that could foster division, while others supported it as a unifying measure. Legal counsel confirmed that the change was primarily a rephrasing of existing regulations.

In terms of special education, a public hearing was held regarding the Orange Unified Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA). The board approved the SELPA Local Plan, with public comments emphasizing the need for enhanced student safety measures, such as metal detectors. Additionally, discussions on school safety and facility improvements were highlighted, with concerns raised about resource allocation and the need for competitive bidding processes.

## 2023-01-05 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The special board meeting held on January 5, 2023, was convened to address significant administrative changes within the district. The meeting, which was called to order by Board President Rick Ledesma, faced scrutiny from some board members and the public regarding its timing during the winter break and the lack of prior notice to Superintendent Dr. Hansen and Assistant Superintendent Mrs. Corella. Despite a motion by Andrea Yamasaki to postpone the meeting, the motion failed with a split vote among the board members.

The board decided to terminate the contract of Superintendent Dr. Hansen with a 30-day notice and placed her on paid administrative leave. Similarly, Assistant Superintendent Mrs. Corella was placed on administrative leave pending a curriculum and educational audit. These decisions were met with opposition from several board members, including Andrea Yamasaki and Kris Erickson, and sparked extensive public comments mostly opposing the terminations. 

In response to these administrative changes, the board appointed Edward Velasquez as the Interim Superintendent and Craig Abercrombie as the Acting Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services, both effective January 9, 2023. The meeting highlighted issues related to school-board ethics, policy changes, community engagement, and parental feedback, as evidenced by the public's strong reaction to the board's decisions and the procedural concerns raised during the meeting.

The virtual school board meeting held on May 7, 2020, addressed several key issues and updates within the Orange Unified School District. Due to the virtual nature of the meeting, all votes were conducted as roll call votes. The meeting began with the establishment of a quorum and adjournment to a closed session to discuss legal and property matters. During the regular session, Dr. Hansen reported on the board's decision to delegate authority to settle workers' compensation claims, which was unanimously approved. 

Key highlights included the recognition of McPherson Magnet School as a "Project Lead the Way" Distinguished School and the success of students in the PTA Reflections Competition. The board acknowledged the challenges and successes of implementing distance learning due to COVID-19, commending the IT department, teachers, and staff for their efforts. Special Education support was also highlighted, with board members expressing appreciation for the resources provided to special education students during remote learning.

Policy changes were discussed, including the approval of various contracts and amendments related to the Measure S Program and classroom furnishings. The board also addressed membership in associations, deciding to table the decision on California School Boards Association membership until the next meeting for further discussion. Additionally, the board recognized the National Day of Prayer, reflecting on the community's efforts to find solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## 2020-01-16 - ORANGE_UNIFIED_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The regular board meeting held on January 16, 2020, involved several key discussions and decisions relevant to the Orange Unified School District. The meeting began with a closed session focused on various personnel and property issues, including a midyear progress review for the Superintendent and discussions on labor negotiations and anticipated litigation. The regular session commenced with the adoption of the agenda, which was adjusted to accommodate the presentation of the Fletcher Elementary Mandarin Immersion Program earlier in the meeting due to the young age of the participating students.

Significant topics discussed during the session included the recognition of achievements within the school district, such as the Mandarin Immersion Program at Fletcher Elementary receiving the California School Boards Association "Golden Bell Award." The board also addressed policy changes and community engagement through discussions on upcoming changes in voting procedures and the importance of Proposition 13 of 2020, which could impact school funding through matching grants. Additionally, the board acknowledged the contributions of Dr. Elsie Briseno-Simonovski, the departing principal of Richland Continuation High School, highlighting her role in the school's recognition as a Model Continuation School.

The meeting also covered special education support, with consent items related to special education students and attorney fee settlements being approved. Parental feedback was encouraged, particularly regarding the new voting procedures and Proposition 13, which were seen as significant for the district's future funding and strategic planning. The board concluded with a public comment session and a discussion on the need for resolutions supporting Proposition 13 due to its potential financial benefits for the district. The meeting adjourned at 9:50 pm.
